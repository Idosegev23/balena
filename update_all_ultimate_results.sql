ROLF SCHLICHT GmbH
ROLF SCHLICHT GmbH  – K Duesseldorf - 19 – 26 October 2022 – hall 3A35

Quality and competence since 1959

ROLF SCHLICHT GmbH is manufacturer of the RS POWDERTECH powder coating machines and RS MULTICUT cutting systems. Our machines have been successfully in use worldwide for more than 60 years.

The RS POWDERTECH electrostatic and pneumatic powder coating systems stand for absolutely dust-free and finely dosed powdering of cables, wires, hoses, profiles and tapes with powdering agents such as talc, graphite, stearates, swelling powders, organic powders, colour powders etc. Their use results in a clean environment that protects workers as well as machines and aggregates.

Depending on the product specification, either the RSC NG, successor to the RSC / PBA powdering machine that has been used successfully for many years, or the new development from the TALKATOR NG series are used.

With the RS MULTICUT series, ROLF SCHLICHT GmbH offers a wide range of system solutions for versatile cutting tasks in the extrusion sequence. Where cutting is not required, a comprehensive range of semi- or fully automatic winders with strapping, tying, shrinking as well as ejecting or depositing systems on pallets or conveyor belts is available.

The field of application for our systems is the production sector of plastic and rubber extrusion for the manufacturing of hoses, tubes, profiles, strips from the smallest diameter range of less than 1 mm in medical technology up to tubes of approx. 100 mm diameter.

We also supply our feeding and cutting systems in GMP design for the pharmaceutical industry and medical technology for the clean room. The systems work in the extrusion line or also outside the line from the coil, the winder or the pallet.

The systems can be adapted to the customer''s wishes and needs in order to achieve the best possible effectiveness.

Our service guarantees the fast delivery of machines and spare parts as well as technical assistance, also on site.

A well-organized sales network in more than 60 countries guarantees a smooth procurement process thanks to the know-how of the local market.

We further completed our product portfolio with ARISTO Cutting Solutions GmbH. The company has been part of our group of companies since 2021 and offers cutting solutions for cutting in production. The flatbed cutters have been used successfully for decades for textile materials in the transportation, automotive and aviation sectors. Both in individual and in series production. The high quality of the solutions enables reliable and highly precise processing of composites such as carbon, prepreg, fiberglass and other fiber composites.

ARISTOMAT cutters are increasingly used in research, production and development because of their suitability for cutting composite semi-finished products in a wide variety of designs and fabric structures.

Jomar Corporation, the leading global manufacturer of injection blow molding (IBM) machinery, has acquired the assets of a local mold making company, enabling the in-house offering of mold and packaging desig', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Founded in 1968, Jomar is a U.S.-based manufacturer focused exclusively on injection blow molding machines. Our equipment is built with 100% U.S.-sourced components and is known worldwide for its durability and high performance. | Jomar Corporation, the leading global manufacturer of injection blow molding (IBM) machinery, has acquired the assets of a local mold making company, enabling the in-house offering of mold and packaging designs, mold creation, and total turnkey solutions for its injection blow molding machinery. The company has set aside a portion of its 50,000 square feet of manufacturing space at its US headquarters in Pleasantville, NJ to be dedicated to mold design, development, and production.  “We are very excited to have received board approval for this acquisition and expansion“ notes Carlos Castro, President of Jomar. “As part of the Indel diversified group, Jomar benefits from being able to respond quickly to market opportunities like this one when they appear. We became aware of the availability of these mold making assets and were able to quickly structure an offer. Jomar has long offered tooling and turnkey services, but in the past those have involved partnering with proven subcontractors, which we will continue to do. But going forward, we will have these capabilities in-house and will now be able to offer them to customers at significantly lower pricing.”     This means process engineers will be involved at every stage of the development process. Benefits include: fully approved production ready tooling; mold development in our R&D center, on dedicated test machines by highly trained design and process personnel; verification and inspection to the approved product drawing; mold development will use resins supplied from the customer’s area; and steel certification on request. Jomar’s turnkey service includes project validation, tool design, tool manufacturing, testing, quality control and commissioning in the customers’ facility, as well as training in Jomar classrooms or on-site education.     Jomar is the world’s leading manufacturer of injection blow molding machinery for the pharmaceutical, health care, personal care, beauty, food, beverage and household products markets. Some of the world’s most recognized brands such as Gerber’s, Crayola, Merck, P&G Unilever, Avon, Gerresheimer Group and Goya have chosen Jomar to handle their packaging needs. More than half of the injection blow mold machines in use throughout the world today were built by Jomar. For customers requiring extrusion blow molding machinery, Jomar is also the exclusive North American distributor for Automa by Magic continuous extrusion and accumulator head EBM models. | Exhibitors & Products | Digital Services Act (DSA)', hall = '14', stand = 'A32', logo_url = 'https://jomarcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/200w.png', logo_file = 'logos/logo_Jomar_Corporation.png', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Ron Gabriele", "role": "Sales Manager", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T01:36:54.024982', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

UL International Germany GmbH
Global safety, performance and compliance leadership

Plastics have become almost inseparable from daily life. Global manufacturers of plastics, resins and other engineered materials continue to innovate toward a safer, more sustainable world, while additive manufacturing is redefining what we once thought possible in both finished products and the manufacturing processes.

Manufacturers are increasingly challenged to develop more environmentally-friendly products and processes while meeting changing customer expectations and satisfying OEM requirements. And as innovation continues to pick up pace, you also need to be confident in the safety and performance of new materials.

We can help. At UL Solutions, we apply our scientific expertise and data to everything from material selection and product design to large-scale production and end-of-life. Our Plastics Recognition Program is globally recognized and can help you demonstrate the safety, quality and suitability of your materials based on a specific set of third-party performance credentials.

The UL Solutions certification materials (UL Solutions Yellow Card® and UL Solutions Blue Card®) can also be used to market and differentiate your products and help downstream manufacturers save valuable time testing end-products. For recycled plastic content, the UL Component Recognition program provides the services needed to maintain the integrity of material certifications.

We will work with your team to help you overcome manufacturing challenges, comply with regulatory requirements and bring safer products to the global market as quickly as possible.

We have now reached a point that allows us to offer our customers pioneering, sustainable PFAS-free solutions for almost all of our products. Therefore BYK will end its production of additives containing PFAS and will be shipping the last batch of the affected products by the end of 2025. By then, we will also be offering PFAS-free solutions for applications in which, currently, additives containing PFAS are still used.Even today, the percentage of PFAS-containing additives in BYK''s extensive product portfolio is very small. As a leading innovator we are convinced that we can help our customers phase out products containing PFAS by offering our pioneering alternatives at an early date and showing new ways in the formulation of sustainable solutions. | Exhibitors & Products | Digital Services Act (DSA)', hall = '5', stand = 'E17', scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-17T23:58:42.062716', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

Covestro Deutschland AG
A setup with a clear focus

We offer a broad range of products and services for varying markets, demands and industries. That’s why we group our portfolio by business specifics and customer needs.
There are two big segments: ‘Performance Materials’ and ‘Solutions & Specialties’. In total, they comprise seven business entities. Each entity is set up according to its individual success factors and integrates all business-critical operations throughout the value chain.
In addition, there are certain cross-company ‘build activities’ to ensure our long-term development. These include sustainability, innovation, digitalization and strategy.

Performance Materials
This segment comprises Covestro’s standard polycarbonates, standard urethane components and the necessary base chemicals. The focus is on reliably delivering commodity products at competitive cost.

Solutions & Specialties
This segment comprises six business entities: Engineering Plastics, Coatings and Adhesives, Tailored Urethanes, Thermoplastic Polyurethanes, Specialty Films, and Elastomers. The focus is on sophisticated products with a high pace of innovation and application technology services.

The why and the how
It’s rarely an easy question to reply: why do you do what you do? But at Covestro, we have the answer, and we want to show it to you. Because we believe a business is defined not only by its products but rather by its holistic framework.

Designed to optimize performance at lower additive concentrations, the company’s latest offering will provide solutions that enhance aesthetics and reduce extraction rates, making it an excellent choice for food contact applications and intermaterial replacement opportunities. More info: k2025.milliken.com | The market increasingly demands polypropylene products with clarity levels approaching those of ultra-clear (UC) materials, particularly for intermaterial replacement opportunities where transparency is crucial. This presentation discusses an innovative solution to optimize clarity performance at lower additive concentrations, eliminating the need for the previously required 3000-4000 ppm to achieve UC clarity. This advancement not only enhances visual appeal but also reduces extraction rates, providing better solutions for applications like food contact. Additionally, attendees will learn how enhanced compatibility with our clarifying agents, compared to previous generation technology, supports sustainability initiatives by improving operational efficiency, facilitating smooth transitions, and effectively blending with post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials. Lastly, the presentation will discuss how chemical stability and lower bloom contribute to longer-lasting aesthetic performance that the polypropylene market demands. k2025.milliken.com', hall = '6', stand = 'A27', scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T02:09:28.346408', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

Marangon Danilo & C. S.r.l.
Marangon is a company that started its life in north-east Italy, where genius and creativity contributed to the economic and human success of the people of the Veneto region. This spirit still feeds the will of the company to grow and improve day by day.
 
In 1961 Danilo Marangon opened the doors of a mechanical turnery that produced high precision pieces for the most varied sectors of use. In 1985, after intense activity and solid professionalism, the company was ready to specialise in the brass insert sector, and soon became a market reference point. The choice of working only with brass allowed Marangon to slim production, making it efficient and competitive. This choice for efficiency resulted in the division of chips from the oil, smoke abatement and constant improvements in the chain of production, which in turn led to high quality production at a truly competitive prices.
Today, Marangon srl is considered to be one of the most technologically advanced companies in the brass insert field, with its large-scale production including: brass inserts for PPR, brass inserts for PE, brass inserts for CPVC, brass inserts for PPSU and PVDF, brass inserts for water filters, brass transition fittings between plastic and plastic, or plastic and metal.
Marangon Danilo & C. believes that one of its greatest successes is the continuity it has with its clients. It is a relationship of trust that goes beyond the normal transaction that usually takes place between buyer and seller. The company can establish a collaboration of total faith and esteem with its clients because the items it produces become part of the clients’ production cycle.

The new premises of Marangon Danilo & C. was opened in Montecchio Maggiore in 1982. It initially covered 1,000 sqm, but by acquiring the nearby land it now extends over a total surface area of 6,500 sqm, 5,000 sqm of which for production and 1,500 sqm for the depots.

The company uses the most modern machinery, and today it has 29 automatic multi-spindle mechanical and numeric control lathes, and 7 single-spindle CNC lathes for producing smaller lots.

Carboliq GmbH
Carboliq® GmbH has developed a process for the oiling of mixed and contaminated waste plastics. This allows the hydrocarbons contained in the waste to be regenerated and made available to industry in liquid form for the production of new, high-quality plastics. Avoiding incineration and substituting fossil oil makes a significant contribution to climate protection and resource conservation. As the energy required for the process is supplied exclusively by electrically driven friction mixers, the carboliq® process can be qualified as a "net-zero technology" when using green electricity. carboliq® is based in Remscheid. A pilot plant is being operated at the waste disposal center in Ennigerloh. The construction of a first industrial plant is planned at the Chempark Dormagen.

carboliq® GmbH has developed a process for oiling plastics of different fractions in which the necessary energy is introduced into the process exclusively through mechanical friction. This results in very low energy consumption for chemical recycling processes. With 100% renewable electricity, the process is also completely CO2 -neutral. High yields of more than 80% can be achieved. The petroleum substitute product obtained is a virgin raw material that can be used, for example, to produce new plastic granulates. This can reduce the use of fossil raw materials in the plastics industry. These granulates are also suitable for the production of new, high-performance films that can be used for packaging demanding products with high quality and hygiene requirements

SIKOPLAST Recycling Technology GmbH
SIKOPLAST Recycling Technology GmbH is a leading medium-sized engineering company based in Troisdorf, near Cologne. Since 1986, we have been dedicated to developing and manufacturing customized plastic recycling systems – combining decades of expertise with cutting-edge technology. Our origins go back to the early 1970s, driven by a clear mission: to recycle plastic waste sustainably, efficiently, and with maximum material protection.
As a full-service partner, we provide tailor-made solutions for both production scrap and post-consumer plastics. Our product range includes state-of-the-art recycling lines with our conical single-screw extruder, washing plants for heavily contaminated materials, shredders, pelletizing systems, silos, conveyors, and screen changers. One of our specialties is in-line recycling for films and nonwovens – where production waste is fed directly back into the line, eliminating intermediate steps like pelletizing.
What makes our technology stand out is the robust, user-friendly design of our conical screw extruders, ensuring highly reliable operation and gentle material processing. Every plant is engineered to the highest German and European quality standards and is individually tailored to the specific application – whether films, fibers, PET flakes, hollow bodies, HDPE containers, or regrind.
With our in-house pilot plant, customers can test materials under real conditions and jointly develop the most efficient recycling process. From the first project idea through design, manufacturing, installation, and commissioning to training and worldwide after-sales service – we are your partner every step of the way.

Our co-exhibitor at the booth:
Andreas Trouvain – TROUVAIN PARTS-SERVICE & CONSULTING
With over 25 years of industry expertise, Andreas Trouvain offers a trusted source for pelletizer die plates, knives, knife holders, water chambers, and cutting rotors – suitable for all major pelletizer brands. His company is known for top-class quality, competitive pricing, and a deep understanding of customers’ day-to-day challenges, delivering practical and reliable solutions.
Come and visit us at the K Trade Fair in Düsseldorf and discover how SIKOPLAST, together with TROUVAIN PARTS-SERVICE & CONSULTING, can take your recycling processes to the next level – with powerful technology, decades of experience, and an uncompromising focus on quality.

MP3 S.R.L.
MP3 was founded in Italy in 1978. In 2016 it became MP3 Srl.

Since its establishment, the company has specialised in the supply of finished products manufactured using traditional plastic materials (PS, PP and PET) in addition to sheet products (ABS, ABS/PMMA e PS).

The new plant in Bazzano, inaugurated in 1998, rises on an 80,000m2 lot of which 45,000 m2 is covered space. The production capacity, the result of the most modern equipment in the field, is 72,000 tons/year.

 Currently, 67% of our production is intended for export

In 2012, MP3 acquired 100% control of AMP Recycling, which boasts a long tradition in the field of plastic material processing. It began making plastic containers in the early ‘70s, especially for the vegetable, flower, plant and tree growing sector and became the national sector leader and a protagonist in Europe.

Moreover, at the end of 2007, AMP inaugurated the new 22,000 m2 facility on a surface area of 36,000 m2 in order to have adequate space and rationalise all the production activities, integrating the thermoforming and extrusion activities with a noteworthy plastics recycling plant dedicated to recovery of PET originating from differentiated waste collection.

BioCote Ltd
BioCote® – Antimicrobial solutions you can trust

Proud members of the British Plastics Federation, BioCote® is a worldwide market-leading antimicrobial additives supplier with an established history of over 30 years. Trusted by leading brands and manufacturers of plastic products, BioCote® takes pride in their technology being recognised for its quality, traceability, and credibility all around the world.

BioCote®’s extensive portfolio of antimicrobial additives includes silver, zinc, and organic compounds, as well as combinations such as silver/zinc blends. Working without an off switch, the technology has demonstrated an 86% reduction in microbes in only 15 minutes and a 99.9% reduction in 24 hours.

The antimicrobial additives can be easily and cost-effectively integrated into a wide variety of polymer materials, formulations, and polymer blends during manufacturing without affecting the colour or mechanical properties of the material. Offering an extensive variety of antimicrobial additives for engineering plastics and commodity polymers in concentrated powder or masterbatch form, the company has the capability to create bespoke polymer-specific masterbatches to meet any moulding or extrusion process.

Designed to have antimicrobial efficacy at low dosage rates, BioCote®’s powder and masterbatch additives do not affect the overall structure of a polymer. This means, if a polymer is recyclable, the addition of BioCote® will not influence its recyclability. ⁠What’s even better, once incorporated into a product, BioCote®’s additives work continuously to protect against odour formation, staining and material degradation caused by microbes. This ultimately helps to prevent early product failure and can reduce the output of resources in manufacturing due to there being fewer, but better quality, products being made – a shift from quantity to quality that is key to progressing towards sustainable production.

At BioCote®, we are committed to making a real difference to any business by working with our customers to deliver distinctive, high-value products to market. Partnering with BioCote® brings additional benefits, such as a comprehensive support package from our multi-disciplined team of antimicrobial specialists, a 24/7 Partner Portal, or brand affiliation with other well-known BioCote® partners.

BioCote® is more than just an antimicrobial additive supplier. We believe in an open, consultative approach to antimicrobial product integration, continuously working in partnership with our customers from product development to market entry and beyond.

Electrically Conductive Polymers as Bipolar ', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Researchers present sustainable materials for industry | Whether it''s films made from apple pomace, environmentally friendly flame retardants or electrically conductive polymers: Fraunhofer UMSICHT is presenting its wide-ranging expertise in the fields of plastics and the circular economy at this year''s K trade fair in Düsseldorf. The researchers can be found from October 8 to 15 at the joint stand of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in Hall 7, Level 0, Stand C05.The exhibit “A Matter of Fruit” demonstrates how pomace from industrial fruit processing can be used to make biodegradable films – an alternative to synthetic materials. Depending on their thickness, the films can be classified visually and characteristically as paper, plastic, or leather and can be used in interior design as well as a substitute for leather. A special aspect of the pomace-based material is its use as a design object: Differently processed apple pomace becomes opaque to translucent, printed, shaped, or welded into a wide variety of products. Verena Brom, designer and initiator of "A Matter of Fruit", brought her start-up project for developing films made from apple pomace as well as crucial expertise into the collaboration funded by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Combined with Fraunhofer UMSICHT''s expertise in continuous plastics processing, the films made from apple pomace could be produced on industrial plants. Agricultural films with nutrients for optimized vegetable cultivation Agricultural films are extremely useful in agriculture. They improve the growth of plants, protect the soil from drying out and minimize weed growth. In the "Humic mulch" project, a research team from Fraunhofer UMSICHT has now developed a biodegradable mulch film with humic substances that further optimizes vegetable cultivation. The nutrients contained in the mulch film are absorbed into the soil together with the film at the end of the growing season.Bio-based flame retardant as an alternative to halogenated compounds The causes of building, industrial or vehicle fires often lie in highly flammable home textiles or inadequately protected plastic components. This is where high-performance flame retardants (FRs) based on halogenated compounds are used. Despite their high effectiveness, FRs are increasingly being withdrawn from the market due to their toxicologically and ecologically problematic properties. Bio-based and more environmentally friendly alternatives are therefore highly relevant. In the project "Bio-Phy-FR" project, the researchers developed a bio-based flame retardant based on phytic acid for products in the textile and plastics processing industry.Networking the textile industry for a circular textile industry 2 to 10 percent of the EU''s environmental impact is attributable to clothing consumption. A transformation towards a circular textile industry requires cooperation between industry, science and society. This is where the "KlarTEXt" project comes in, developing measures for a socially and ecologically sustainable textile industry and bringing all stakeholders together. The "Digital Textile Stakeholder Map" at the K trade fair shows how this networking can be activated.Thermally and electrically conductive polymers for hydrogen applications and heating components Another focus of the trade fair presentation is on thermally and electrically conductive polymers: UMSICHT researchers can produce ultra-thin composite biopolar sheets cost-effectively using a patented, continuous powder-to-roll process. These thermoplastic-based films can form the basis of innovative stack designs for electrolysers and fuel cells, for example: With their help, stacks can be welded and built without seals. This means that sealing elements in the stack are replaced by weld seams, which in particular reduces vulnerable sealing surfaces in the stack and thus reduces production waste. Furthermore, both the number of components in the stack and the number of stacking processes and thus the assembly effort can be reduced in equal measure. In addition to the bipolar plates themselves, a seal-free PEM electrolysis stack and seal-free PEM fuel cells will also be on display at the K trade fair.The UMSICHT researchers will also be presenting heatable heat-shrinkable tubing at the K trade fair - an innovative alternative to the heating tapes and heating cords currently available on the market. They open up new possibilities, particularly in pipe trace heating for heat retention or frost protection in the process and food industries.Does that sound interesting? Then make an appointment directly with our colleagues at the K trade fair. | Exhibitors & Products | Digital Services Act (DSA)', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Joachim Danzig", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T00:59:23.843798', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

NISSEI ASB GmbH
Under the corporate principles "Generate affluence for people and society" and "Maintain company growth by providing high level technology and service," we have been developing our business with the aim of popularizing safe and convenient plastic containers for nearly 45 years. We are proud that we have been delivering injection stretch blow molding machines and molds to clients in more than 130 countries, contributing to the wellbeing of people all over the world.

Our company history is also the history of PET bottles. ASB started its business in 1978, one year after the first introduction of PET bottles in Japan (1977). Since then, the lightweight property, safety, and recyclability of plastic materials, especially PET, have been widely recognized around the world, leading to the widespread use of plastics. Plastic containers are used to contain a great variety of products, from refreshing beverages to liquors, seasoning agent, detergents, and pharmaceutical agents. We expect that the use of plastic containers will become increasingly popular in the future in a diverse range of fields.

In the midst of the complicated social situation, we may face many difficulties in the days ahead. But we are committed to delivering even more convenience to our customers around the world, constantly reminding ourselves that we should never be easily satisfied with the status quo. We would like to ask for your continued support and encouragement in the years to come.

Symphony Environmental Ltd
PREMIUM
Symphony Environmental is a world leader in the development of additives to make ordinary plastic biodegradable and protective technologies to enhance plastic products

Our technology is sold into nearly 100 countries around the world, with applications in retail, medical and manufacturing industries with a focus on the defence of both environmental and human health.

We develop controlled-life plastic technology solutions which help tackle the problem of microplastics in the environment by turning ordinary plastic, at the end of its service-life and in the presence of oxygen, into biodegradable material.    It is then no longer a plastic and can be bio-assimilated by bacteria and fungi on land or sea. The technology is branded d2w® and its logo appears on many thousands of tonnes of plastic packaging and products around the world.    In addition, Symphony has developed a range of additives, concentrates and master-batches marketed under its d2p® brand,  which can be incorporated in a wide variety of plastic and non-plastic products to give them protection against many different types of bacteria, fungi, algae, moulds,  insects, fouling and fire.

Symphony has a diverse and growing customer base and has established itself as a strong global business with over 74 distributors around the world.   Products made with Symphony’s plastic technologies are now available in nearly 100 countries and in many different product applications.  Symphony is accredited to ISO9001 and ISO14001.

Symphony is a member of The Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association (www.biodeg.org)(OPA), the Society for the Chemical Industry (UK), and the Pacific Basin Environmental Council.

From the initial idea to the recycled product at full speed - prototyping
R', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Lamy and HolyPoly have won one of the coveted awards at the world''s largest trade fair for plastic recycling, the Plastics Recycling Show Europe. In the category "Household & Leisure Product," the aquaplus re paint box, which we developed together with C. Josef Lamy GmbH, was named the winner.The paint box is made of 99.4% recycled plastic (rPS) and proves that sustainable products are possible without compromising on quality or price. And as if that weren''t enough, the LAMY aquaplus re is also a real eye-catcher: its marble design makes each product unique - and shows the entire industry just how stylish successful plastic recycling can be.The paint box is certified according to the toy standard DIN EN 71-3 and is offered at retail at the same price as the sister model made from virgin plastic. As the starting point for LAMY''s plastic transition, the development of this recycled paint box answered fundamental questions about technical properties, legal requirements, and material availability. Now, the project can serve as a blueprint for transforming the entire product range. | International technology group ANDRITZ, a leading supplier to the pulp and paper industry, has signed an exclusive cooperation agreement with the German recycling pioneer HolyPoly to provide a comprehensive recycling solution for used paper machine clothing to paper producers across Europe. The new service enables mills to recycle all forming fabrics and felts at the end of their service life, contributing to a more circular economy.Under this first-of-its-kind agreement, HolyPoly, a specialist in the recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, has been licensed by ANDRITZ to collect used paper machine clothing (PMC) from paper mills and recycle it.Currently, a total of 7,000 tons of PMC is discarded from paper machines in Europe each year. Most of this waste is incinerated or, in some cases, landfilled. The new agreement between ANDRITZ and HolyPoly provides an immediate solution for the recycling of PMC and contributes to increasing the circularity of post-consumer waste in paper production."We worked intensively with universities and plastics recycling experts to develop a suitable solution for recycling PMC. Once we had it, we needed an experienced partner to scale up the process and bring the concept to life," said Jan Freudenberg, Director R&D Forming Fabrics, ANDRITZ. "HolyPoly is the perfect fit for our concept. They have the necessary waste removal certifications, logistics networks, and know-how to bring used PMC into the circular economy."Niklas Bäumer, Project Owner Recycling Programs, HolyPoly, said, "We are delighted to be working with ANDRITZ on PMC recycling and impressed by their commitment to providing customers with sustainable solutions. This is a pioneering joint project, with both companies dedicated to solving important challenges in the European paper industry''s circularity. With our new service, paper mills can be assured that their used PMC will be properly recycled, and their high-quality plastics will be used in new products."As part of the service, PMC from ANDRITZ and all other OEMs and manufacturers can be collected and recycled through HolyPoly''s extensive network of recycling operations and partners. HolyPoly is a young German company with a dedicated team of plastics recycling experts who recognize the significant value of discarded post-consumer waste. The company has extensive knowledge in waste collection, logistics and processes involved in the recycling and utilization of recycled plastics. | Exhibitors & Products | Digital Services Act (DSA)', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Matthias Röder", "role": "Head of Marketing", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Fridolin Pflüger", "role": "Managing Director", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Stefan Canditt", "role": "Sales Manager", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Laura Cordes", "role": "CRO & Director Circular Business Design", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T01:20:27.865948', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

Smarter operation, bigger yields.🧩 DMZIII: Multi-material mastery. Stunning precision (±0.005°) in one brilliant machine.✅ MK6 PRO: Uncompromising quality. Greener, smarter, and efficient.🧠 iChen™ Smart Family: Your entire Industry 4.0 Solutions.Discover the future of injection molding with Chen Hsong at Hall 13, Stand B43. | Across factories worldwide, a subtle yet seismic shift is taking place in the way goods are brought into existence – a journey from the predictable hum of machinery to the intelligent, adaptive pulse of the Smart Factory. This evolution, far from being a technological upgrade, represents a fundamental shift in how we design, produce, and manage goods. Understanding this progression, from the earliest factory workshop to the sophisticated smart factory, is essential for any business aiming to thrive in the modern industrial era.From Manual Labour to Automated EfficiencyThe story begins with the manual workshop, a world where human skill and experience are the primary drivers of production. While offering flexibility and low initial costs, this stage is inherently limited by human capacity for error, fatigue, and the sheer pace of production. The subsequent step, the lights out factory, marks a significant leap forward. Here, the fully automated factory no longer relies on human labour for production, and as such light is no longer needed. Machines take the reins of repetitive tasks, boosting speed, consistency, and safety. However, this increased efficiency often operates within predefined parameters, lacking the agility needed for true responsiveness. The Dawn of Digitalisation: Data as the New CurrencyThis shift to industrial automation happens in parallel with the development of digitalised factory. The undigitalised factory, still reliant on manual records, soon gives way to the paperless digitalised factory. This pivotal stage sees the introduction of digital systems like MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning). Suddenly, data becomes more than just records; it''s a valuable asset, enabling better process tracking and laying the groundwork for digital management. The digitalised factory emerges as the next frontier, where flexible automation is deeply intertwined with information systems. Here, data begins to demonstrate tangible application value, hinting at the powerful insights to come. But the true potential is unlocked when we move towards creating a digital mirror of the physical world.The Rise of the Digital Twin: Industry 4.0The digital twin factory represents a groundbreaking concept: a virtual replica of the physical factory, allowing for sophisticated simulation, predictive maintenance, and optimised process flows. This stage is about understanding and guiding the physical world through computational analysis, bridging the gap between the virtual and the real.And with the digital twin factory, are are able to achieve a new breakthrough in manufacturing: The smart factory. This is not just the marriage of automation and digitalisation; it''s about intelligent, adaptive operations driven by real-time data. The smart factory excels at making dynamic decisions, continuously learning, and optimising processes autonomously. It''s a factory that anticipates challenges, personalises production, and adapts to market demands with unprecedented agility.Empowering the Transition: Chen Hsong''s iChen™ Smart FamilyThe journey to the smart factory can seem daunting, but innovative solutions are making this transformation more accessible than ever. Chen Hsong''s iChen™ Smart Family exemplifies this shift. Their integrated ecosystem is designed to empower manufacturers of all sizes: iChen™ Smart Factory : This service provided by Chen Hsong forms the essential backbone, enabling smart automation and the crucial integration of information systems with manufacturing equipment – a cornerstone of the Digital Factory. We deliver turnkey solutions to fulfill all your production needs: from a small production cell to a lights out factory. iChen™ Cloud : Acting as the "cloud-scale brain," it transforms raw data into real-time operational insights which can also be visualised through our dashboards. This is vital for the analysis and actionable intelligence required for both Digital Twin and Smart Factory operations. It allows for agile planning, streamlines processes, and allows for improved operational efficiency. iChen™ AI Molder : This cutting-edge offering brings true intelligence to the production floor. By leveraging AI for enhanced molding precision and stability, it embodies the core principles of Industry 4.0 in the age of AI: data-driven decision-making and continuous, active learning for optimisation. AI Molder shortens mold trials, stabilizes production, improves quality consistency and automates parameter adjustment and machine tuning.The brilliance of Chen Hsong''s approach lies in its modularity and ease of deployment. This means that the complex, transformative power of Industry 4.0 is no longer the exclusive domain of large corporations. Manufacturers of any scale can now take confident steps towards building their own intelligent, adaptive, and competitive future.

Sales & Marketing Director Mikko', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Bjørn Thorsen A/S is pleased to announce being appointed by Celanese as their focused distributor for elastomers in Europe. This strategic move aims to strengthen the position of Celanese''s products across the EU, contribute to the development of new applications, and customized solutions according to customer needs. | Working in the plastics industry brings more than technical expertise - it also calls for strong event management skills. At Bjørn Thorsen, organizing and participating in industry events has long been a key part of our business. Each year is typically packed, and 2025 has been no exception, especially since securing our role as a  Pan-European distributor of TPEs from Celanese .This year, however, brought a fresh perspective. It has been all about reimagining both existing and new markets with renewed focus and creativity. Months of brainstorming, designing, and refining our messaging led us to a clear and bold direction: our full commitment to Elastomers.May marked one of the busiest and most exciting periods so far, as we exhibited at both  Plassteknik in Malmö  and  Plastpol in Kielce . At these events, we unveiled a completely new stand design inspired by four iconic films. This is where creativity met strategy - using universally recognizable cinematic themes and quotes to communicate our message in an engaging and memorable way.Each movie reference was carefully selected to highlight core values of our Elastomers portfolio: performance, versatility, innovation, quality, and credibility.

ADVANCED & FUNCTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR BIOCOMPOSITES S.L.
ADBioplastics is a Spanish company specialised in the development and commercialisation of advanced additives and bioplastics.

Our PLA-Premium bioplastic improves elongation at break (mechanical properties) by up to 70%, achieving a version of PLA Premium, that is, less brittle and more elastic. We also improve processability (cycle times and density comparable to PET) and barrier properties: to water vapour and oxygen, among many other advantages.

PLA-Premium enables the development of high quality bio-based and compostable plastics, becoming the ideal substitute for conventional plastics in many sectors, such as packaging (food, cosmetics and nutrition), 3D printing, medicine, textiles, construction, agriculture and consumer goods.

Our products are bio-based and compostable, and we produce them with raw materials from renewable sources such as corn, sugar cane or beets that, under industrial conditions, disintegrate in just three months (OK Compost Industrial by TÜV Austria).

PLA-Premium compostable bioplast', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | ADBioplastics will showcase its latest compostable solutions to transform the plastics industry at the Italian trade fair Greenplast 2025 | ADBioplastics , a Spanish manufacturer of advanced and compostable additives and bioplastics, will present its latest solutions in sustainable and competitive alternatives for the plastics industry, manufactured with its compostable bioplastic  PLA-Premium , for various industries that are demanding green solutions such as food, cosmetics, agriculture or consumer goods, among others, at the  Greenplast 2025  trade fair, which will take place from May 27 to 30 in Milan, Italy.During this event, held in conjunction with the IPACK-IMA, Print4All and Intralogistica Italia trade fairs, ADBioplastics will have an exhibition space for these solutions, specifically booth A12 in Hall 14 of the Milan Fair.  Bio-based and compostable products as a sustainable alternative to fossil plastics  Among the latest case studies to be exhibited is the joint project with Nua Cosmetics, Provei Global and ITC Packaging in the development of a bio-based and compostable bottle for baby shower gel and shampoo, a 500 ml product with a dispensing cap made of PLA-Premium bioplastic, a more sustainable option to PET bottles that not only takes care of the little ones, but also of the planet.Another of the innovative products to be shown at the ADBioplastics exhibition space is compostable cutlery for food, mainly for the ice cream industry, a project that solves one of the major problems of single-use spoons or forks that, due to their size and use, hinder the recycling system or are not recycled correctly, contaminating the environment. This single-use cutlery is suitable for food contact and allows organic recycling at the end of the product’s useful life.Finally, one of the most outstanding innovations to be presented will be the BioLoop Band, a new type of filament used as a twistband closure (a flexible wire, usually made of steel or aluminum, coated with a plastic layer, used to securely close various products). This development was first shown at the U.S. NPE show and aims to transform the use of single-use closures in sectors such as food, agriculture and consumer goods.This new filament emerges as a sustainable alternative to traditional twistband closures, either with or without metal core, made of materials such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or LDPE (low density polyethylene), commonly used to close products such as sliced bread or toy packaging, cables, extension cords and other household or electronic products. In the agricultural field, it is used for the trellising of horticultural and fruit crops, favoring the guidance of plants in systems such as Guyot pruning, widely used in viticulture for grape production. The mixed structure of conventional closures makes them difficult to recycle and generates a negative environmental impact due to their composition and small size.In contrast, BioLoop Band is made from PLA-Premium, a bioplastic that provides environmental and functional advantages. Its main benefits include: a reduction of up to 55% in the use of material compared to traditional closures with a metal core, its compostability (it can be disposed of with organic waste), respect for soil fertility, its ability to elongate with heat (which facilitates plant growth without damaging it), and its resistance to both impact and torsion, allowing its repeated use in closure processes.  Sustainable commitment and international collaboration drive  Alongside its latest innovations, ADBioplastics will showcase a wide variety of products from its portfolio, including 3D printed parts, packaging such as bottles and jars, candle holders, single-dose formats for cosmetics, flexible flowpacks, clamshells, closures, and plastic films with different characteristics and thicknesses. These developments respond to the growing demands for sustainability in industries such as food, cosmetics, agriculture, medicine, 3D printing, textiles and consumer goods.In the emerging additive manufacturing sector, PLA-Premium is setting a new stage in the development of biomaterials thanks to its excellent performance in terms of both flowability and mechanical strength. Special grades of PLA-Premium allow it to be blended with plant or mineral fibres, resulting in high-performance bio-based filaments.All products using PLA-Premium are both compostable and bio-based, and show significant improvements over pure PLA, especially in terms of physical properties and ease of processing. This material is obtained from renewable resources such as corn or sugar cane and can disintegrate in less than three months under industrial composting conditions, which is endorsed by the OK Compost Industrial certification issued by TÜV Austria.These solutions are fully in line with international sustainability policies. In Italy, one of the most advanced countries in regulating compostable materials, the government is actively promoting biotechnology and bio-manufacturing with the aim of replacing up to 90% of fossil plastics in two decades. Since 2018, it bans non-compostable lightweight plastic bags, allows single-use products if they are made from certified compostable materials, and offers tax incentives to companies that develop or use sustainable bioplastics. Italy, in fact, has already exceeded its 2030 recycling targets for compostable bioplastics. | It all started when  Provei Global  and  Nua Cosmetics  approached  ADBioplastics , a manufacturer of compostable additives and bioplastics, with the need to offer the market a bottle for shower gel and shampoo that would promote sustainability, respect for the environment and reflect the company’s values. This 500 ml bottle with a dispensing cap is a significant step forward in the mission of the companies involved to promote sustainability.Unlike conventional plastics, bio-based plastics come from renewable and non-fossil sources, which reduces the carbon footprint and, as it is also a biodegradable material, it can be converted into compost, CO2 and water as it decomposes through the biological action of certain microorganisms under industrial conditions.“At Provei Global, with Biositivo, we are committed to creating products that are fully integrated into the natural cycle, without generating waste. It is a pleasure to have partners such as Nua Cosmetics, ITC Packaging and ADBioplastics, who share our vision and have helped us develop a product that not only cares for the little ones, but also for the planet”, says Sébastien Favier, CEO of Provei Global.From a technical point of view, the  PLA-Premium  developed by ADBioplastics improves the properties of generic bioplastics, maintaining transparency and improving the barrier to both oxygen and water vapour, as well as improving toughness and impact resistance. This solution is not only environmentally friendly, but also promotes organic recycling when deposited in the brown bin, contributing to the circularity of materials and the reduction of waste in the environment.Carlos Soto, CEO of Nua Cosmetics, says: “This project has been an exciting technical challenge. Achieving the highest quality baby gel formula, which is also compatible with compostable packaging, reinforces our commitment to sustainability and the well-being of our little ones”.Xavier Serrano, PET Business Unit Manager at  ITC Packaging : “We help our customers in the process of developing their packaging to improve its sustainability and carbon footprint. With this project we have added a Bio and Compostable line to our portfolio of packaging solutions, which join the other sustainable solutions developed so far (rPET food and non-food)”.This project is in line with the objectives of ADBioplastics to contribute to the sustainability strategies of companies in order to achieve the legislative requirements set for 2030 at international level. The PLA-Premium bioplastic is suitable for food and cosmetic contact and has the OK Compost Industrial seal from TÜV Austria, certifying the transformation of the bioplastic into compost under industrial conditions, according to the EN 13432 standard, in a period of less than 6 months. *New published in  ITC Packaging ,  Alimarket ,  TecnoBebidas ,  MundoPlast ,  EnvasPrés ,  News Packaging ,  Clúster Envase ,  Yahoo! Finance ,  PackNode ,  Packaging Gateway ,  Bioplastics News  and  Packaging MEA . | ADBioplastics  and  Iraga Servicios  have developed a sustainable packaging for cutlery used in catering for air and ground passenger transport. It is a 100% compostable and bio-based flow pack packaging.This product maintains the quality characteristics and offers advantages in terms of production, such as reducing the sealing temperature by around 50%. As a consequence, CO2 emissions are reduced both in the manufacturing process of the product and in the packaging process.Furthermore, the new packaging offers a compostable solution, as the material is certified OK Compost Industrial by TÜV Austria, which verifies that the material disintegrates into its basic components (carbon dioxide and water) within a period of approximately 3 months under industrial compostability conditions. In this way, according to the current recycling circuit, the material can be deposited in the brown (organic) container and then transferred to a composting plant.  A long-term project  The main objective of this agreement has been to offer a more sustainable alternative for shrink-wrapping processes by means of a film supplied by ADBioplastics in the catering of Iraga Servicios’ main passenger transport customers, thus promoting compliance with legislative requirements, innovation and the circular economy.This film has been obtained from TecnoBi grades of  PLA-Premium  compostable bioplastic, developed by ADBioplastics. The technology used to manufacture the film is film cast extrusion, resulting in a product with characteristics similar to those of a film made from conventional plastic. PLA-Premium can also be processed on conventional equipment, so it does not require any additional investment in equipment or infrastructure. Sustainability is a fundamental pillar for  ADBioplastics  and  Iraga Servicios , which through this cooperation agreement will be able to offer products and materials for compostable and bio-based packaging, in line with their long-term management and innovation strategies.This project demonstrates that it is possible to combine respect for the environment and social welfare with business profit, contributing to compliance with the sustainability objectives set out in the Law on Waste and Contaminated Soil for a Circular Economy and the Royal Decree on Packaging and Packaging Waste. ADBioplastics is a startup dedicated to the manufacture of tailor-made bioplastics that improve the mechanical properties of virgin PLA for food, beverage and cosmetic packaging  applications , as well as other plastic products for 3D printing, textiles, medicine, agriculture and construction.Iraga Servicios is a company specialised, among others, in shrink wrapping and manual handling, with extensive experience in the airline catering and ground passenger transport sector.

Edilteco at K 2025: Industrial EPS', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Edilteco – Italian technology for advanced EPS processing | Edilteco at K 2025: Industrial EPS Technology for High-Performance Insulation | Edilteco returns to K 2025, the world’s leading trade fair for plastics and rubber, reaffirming its role as a key player in the industrial transformation of expanded polystyrene (EPS) for the building sector. With over 40 years of research, development, and global partnerships, Edilteco has established itself as a technological benchmark in the production of thermal insulation materials using EPS. Its presence at K 2025 highlights a unique industrial offering: complete production systems for manufacturing high-performance, lightweight insulating products on a global scale. A Fully Integrated Industrial Approach Edilteco designs and constructs complete industrial plants for EPS processing, providing end-to-end solutions that cover the entire production cycle — from raw EPS expansion to the coating, mixing, and packaging of insulation compounds. This integrated system ensures absolute control over output quality, manufacturing efficiency, and adaptability to different regional market requirements. Exclusive Technology: The E.I.A. Additive A cornerstone of Edilteco’s process is the patented E.I.A. (Edilteco Insulation Additive), which coats each EPS bead to ensure stable and homogeneous bonding with cement-based mixtures. This additive eliminates flotation and separation issues typical of untreated EPS, allowing for faster startup (within 45 days), consistent results, and the production of lightweight, thermally efficient mortars ready for the construction industry. A Complete Range of EPS Production Plants Edilteco’s portfolio includes several dedicated production lines designed for scalability and industrial performance: ·        EPS Expansion Plant – For the automated transformation of raw EPS into high-quality, lightweight beads ·        Politerm® Evolution Plant – For coating EPS beads with E.I.A. for use in thermal insulating mortars ·        Drymix Plant – For blending and bagging ready-to-use lightweight EPS-based mortars ·        ECAP® Plant – For producing prefinished EPS insulation boards for external wall insulation (EWI) systems ·        Smartblocks Plant – For the manufacture of lightweight insulating EPS-concrete blocks for the building sector Each system is designed for efficient, high-volume production with minimal labor, making them ideal for manufacturers seeking scalable and sustainable insulation solutions. Partnering for Growth With over 50 licensed partners around the world, Edilteco provides a strategic model for industrial growth. Partners benefit from access to Edilteco’s know-how, technical support, and product evolution, enabling them to introduce top-tier EPS insulation products into their markets quickly and efficiently. At K 2025, Edilteco welcomes manufacturers and investors interested in discovering how this technology can become a platform for expansion, innovation, and leadership in energy-efficient construction. Edilteco is more than a supplier—it is a global partner in insulation technology. | A sign of continuity, with a focus on the future. Rosacometta, a historic company specializing in the production of machines for concrete blocks and elements, now part of the Edilteco Group, presents its new logo and website: two symbols of an evolution that strongly combines tradition and innovation. New brand identity for Rosacometta The update of the visual identity and the digital platform is not just an aesthetic choice, but represents the evolution of a company that, since November 25, 2020, has embarked on a major renewal journey under the guidance of ESB Srl, which has significantly reorganized the technical and commercial departments.With this rebranding, Rosacometta confirms its commitment to growth and adaptation to the new challenges of the industry, while maintaining a strong connection to its long tradition.The new logo retains iconic elements from the past, such as the globe and the font style, which symbolize the company''s solidity and international vision. At the same time, the more modern and clean lines reflect an increasingly dynamic corporate identity, focused on innovation.In parallel, the website has also been completely revamped to provide a more intuitive, modern, and functional browsing experience. With an improved structure, updated content, and enhanced accessibility, the new website allows visitors to easily explore the products, solutions, and services offered by Rosacometta.

Terbrack Kunststoff GmbH & Co. KG
Future-oriented from the very beginning.

For more than 60 years TERBRACK has been known as a pioneer in the production and processing of high-quality engineering plastics.

Already at its foundation in 1954 TERBRACK started innovatively and was the first company to process so-called ultra-high molecular weight and high molecular weight polyethylenes. Customers all over the world benefit from these products from Vreden in Münsterland, which are initially manufactured as pressed sheets at TERBRACK and then further processed into finished parts that can be found in almost the entire machinery and plant engineering sector.

Extruded profiles and round bars as chain and belt guides, guide rails and sliding strips complement or extend the manufacturing and thus the application possibilities.

In particular, ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylenes, which are, incidentally, an extraordinarily special material among plastics, represent a significant advantage due to their outstanding sliding properties, low mechanical wear, the extremely high impact strength as well as the good chemical resistance, they can be used in a wide range of applications as lining elements in silo and bunker linings, ships and trucks, in filling and packaging plants, in transport, storage and conveyor technology, in chemical and electroplating technology as seals, sliding and guide rollers, gear wheels for fittings as well as in the food industry, etc. are also used.

Reliable quality, selected raw materials as well as strict and permanent controls during the entire process chain guarantee the quality of our products
In addition, our qualities comply with the valid food regulations. (EU 10/2011/EG; FDA: 21 CFR 177.1520; FDA: 21 CFR 178.3297)
Computer-controlled manufacturing processes ensure a consistently high level of semi-finished and finished parts.

Many years ago TERBRACK introduced a quality management system according to the international standard DIN EN ISO 9001:2015, as well as an energy management system according to ISO 50001.

TERBRACK is today with about 120 employees one of the leading producers in the field of processing ultra-high and high molecular weight polyethylenes. But also other high performance polymers are processed at TERBRACK.
For this purpose, we have state-of-the-art facilities at our disposal on a covered production and storage area of 16,000 sqm at one location.

Based on our decades of experience and a consistent orientation towards the future, we realize individual technical solutions together with our customers

VEKA AG Ein Unternehmen der Laumann Gruppe
Quality as a principle

As the world market leader for PVC window and door profiles, VEKA is also the guarantor of unconditional quality for VEKAPLAN sheet systems. Because only a product of consistently high quality enables problem-free processing and reliably meets all requirements in practice. To ensure this quality, we continuously carry out strict controls along the entire production chain - from the testing of the delivered raw materials in our in-house laboratory and regular color matching to the final inspection of the extruded sheets and foiling.

The success story of VEKA AG began in 1969, and the company has grown to become the global market leader for plastic profiles, sheets and moulding systems. With 38 subsidiaries, further successful chapters have been added. One of them is called VEKAPLAN. Since 1985, an independent division for plastic sheets has been able to establish itself on the market worldwide under this name

A company is always as good as its employees. For this simple but decisive reason, VEKA focuses on the greatest possible qualification in the selection, education and training of its employees. After all, VEKAPLAN partners rightly expect the highest level of performance, service and competence.

Partnership - the wishes of our customers represent the central orientation for all our actions.

Cumapol Emmen BV
The mission of Cumapol is to produce sustainable thermoplastic Polyester specialties by combining the different recycling technologies, close the Polyester loop and create a high performance product without using fossil based chemicals.

Cumapol Emmen is a toll converter serving the PET industry by converting amorphous, low IV modified Polyesters into valuable PET grades suitable for the intended application.

Cumapol offers different services in Polyester upgrading: Regranulation, Compounding, Crystallization and Solid State Polymerization for a wide range of virgin and recycled Polyesters. Cumapol has the positive expert opinion from EFSA, which means that recycled material processed by Cumapol can be reused in most direct food contact applications.

In 2013, we started with the recycling of post-consumer bottles, back into a bottle grade suitable for direct food contact and the development of special grades based on recycled materials. Nowadays, 50% of our capacity is occupied with the upgrading of recycled PET and 50% with virgin specialties with experience in PET, Copolyesters, PBT, PEF, etc.

We are continuously improving our custom made Polyesters based on mechanical recycling. With the start of exploring chemical recycling and the use of bio-based monomers we made the next steps in circularity but we have many plans to improve, please check our website www.cumapol.com or contact us for any questions.

Fych Technologies S.L.
At Fych Technologies, we break through the barriers that keep complex plastics out of the circular economy.
We specialize in the mechanical recycling of the most difficult plastic waste, multi-layer films, laminated packaging and plastics with strong odors or contaminants that conventional recyclers cannot process. Our approach is based on two patented, solvent-free technologies developed exclusively by our team:

Delamination, which separates bonded layers of different polymers and materials.
Vapor decontamination, which removes over 96% of odors and contaminants without the use of toxic chemicals.

These technologies form the basis for our unique Advanced Mechanical Recycling Technology, which we have already validated through successful industrial pilot projects. Now we are expanding: our first industrial recycling plant with a processing capacity of 500 kg/h is currently under construction in Spain.

Our project "ReMLP - Recycling Multilayer Plastics" has been selected and funded by the European Innovation Council (EIC), recognizing not only our technological potential but also our industrial ambition. We are proud to hold the exclusive exploitation rights for these ground-breaking innovations.

We work closely with key players throughout the plastics value chain:
Plastic product manufacturers seeking recyclability
Plastics processors seeking sustainable and cost-effective solutions
Recyclers who want to process complex and contaminated materials
Distributors and packaging suppliers interested in recyclable alternatives
Brands and retailers looking to reduce their environmental impact
Research centers and innovation partners exploring future recycling models
Public institutions and private investors promoting green technologies

Our vision is to turn every complex plastic into a valuable resource.
Our goal is to make plastics recycling smarter, cleaner and more efficient - and todo thistogether with those who are ready to change the industry.

Let''s work together at K to shape the future of circular plastics!!!

ITENE Packaging, Transport & Logistics Research Center
ITENE is a leading research and technology center specialized in packaging, transport, and logistics. For over 30 years, we have supported companies worldwide through R&D projects, testing services, technical assistance, and training, providing technological solutions that drive innovation and sustainability across the entire packaging value chain.

We help companies incorporate circularity into their packaging strategies, working from material development to end-of-life. Our team designs and formulates new packaging materials with specific goals such as improving technical performance, integrating recycled content, reducing material use, and enhancing the functionality of biopolymers. These developments always consider industrial scalability and economic viability.

We also assess both new and existing packaging solutions from a variety of perspectives, including food safety, reusability, recyclability, compostability, and distribution efficiency. Based on these evaluations, we adapt and optimize packaging systems to meet functional and regulatory requirements while improving their environmental profile.

In terms of end-of-life, we develop and improve a wide range of technologies including mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic recycling, as well as systems for composting and reuse. Our research extends to innovative approaches that enable the recovery of complex packaging materials and the transformation of waste into valuable raw materials with high-quality properties.

Headquartered in Valencia (Spain), ITENE operates in over 12,000 square meters of its own facilities, including 5,000 square meters of laboratories and pilot plants equipped with advanced technology. These infrastructures allow us to validate the performance and functionality of packaging and materials under real and simulated conditions.

Between 2018 and 2024, more than 2,000 companies relied on our team of over 200 highly qualified professionals. We work with clients and partners internationally, serving a wide range of industries such as food and beverage, cosmetics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, logistics, distribution, recycling, and raw materials.

At ITENE, we innovate, create, and grow—empowering the packaging ecosystem to meet the challenges of today and lead the transformation of tomorrow.

Bernhard Ide GmbH & Co. KG Werkzeug- und Maschinenbau für die Kunststoffverarbeitung
When Bernhard Ide moved into his first factory workshops in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen in 1957 he laid the foundations for a successful industrial concern. Over more than 50 years IDE has developed from a small family undertaking into an accomplished and multi-functional medium-sized manufacturing enterprise serving the plastics industry. Modular designed machine and tooling systems which are easily adaptable to customer specifications have made IDE an internationally renowned leader in the extrusion sector today.

Our systems and services cover the entire extrusion process. We produce all of the machines and tooling systems that are necessary to process thermoplastics. We are continually developing our products in collaboration with customers and external partners and the results of that co-operation serve as the basis for designing and manufacturing new and better systems which save work and increase productivity. Our machinery and tooling systems are manufactured with technological know-how and perfected craftsmanship. They not only ensure reliable production, but are adaptable to your growing demands and can be easily retrofitted.

IDE machine and tooling systems have an excellent reputation world-wide. The longevity and dependability of our machines is legendary and our wide range of equipment allows tailored solutions for every branch of industry. But the best about our machines are the practically endless combinations and extensions possible. IDE machine modules make adaptation to new production conditions quick and easy. That is why our machines are utilised in precision fields such as the automotive, medical and the electrical industries.

In extrusion the profile is only as good as the tooling system. Only the very latest production techniques in tooling manufacture are practised at IDE. Our highly-qualified and experienced toolmakers carry out precision work on every order. Our special know-how is where plastic comes into contact with metal. This knowledge enables us to design and manufacture perfect tooling systems for every extrusion project.

Quick and uncomplicated help is a matter of fact. Many of our customers have enjoyed decades of complete IDE support. We accompany our customers with a variety of comprehensive services far beyond the purchase of machinery and tooling.

IDE is and remains committed to extrusion.

Colorfix Masterbatches, based in Paraná, will be present in Pavilion 8B – Stand H30, as a co-exhibitor in partnership with ApexBrasil and Think Plastic Brazil, presenting two innovations: the Marble Line and Revora CO₂RE Carbon Reduced, which represents the future of the sector.The Marble Line combines sophisticated aesthetics and high performance, with 85 color options and a strikingly realistic marbled effect, serving segments such as household goods, luxury packaging, and automotive. Revora CO₂RE is a disruptive technology that incorporates CO₂ into the production of compounds, reducing the carbon footprint and boosting the circular economy.“We will take this to the global showcase of the plastics industry because these solutions reflect the distinctive design, technological advancement, and environmental commitment that are the pillars of our company,” says Colorfix CEO Francielo Fardo. For him, “more than just exhibiting products, participation in Feira K 2025 will be strategic for expanding the brand''s international presence, strengthening partnerships, and anticipating trends that will shape the industry in the coming years,” he points out. Colorfix has participated in previous editions of Feira K, but as a visitor, an opportunity that brought many ideas that were used in the company''s daily activities. "This will be the first time we will be participating as exhibitors. We want to show that it is possible to combine technical performance, beauty, and environmental responsibility, delivering solutions to the market that make a difference for the future," explains Fardo, who will be alongside eight other company representatives participating in the fair. From Brazil to the world With an annual production of nearly 3,000 tons of specialized masterbatches, Colorfix currently has a portfolio of around 90,000 colors and additives, which promote the improvement of both products and customer processes. Some of these products, including the Marble line and the Revora brand, are already part of the collection of the prestigious Material Connexion Innovation Library, located in New York (USA), which has more than 10,000 material profiles, carefully selected to bring the most innovative trends and technologies in the world.In recent decades, the company has been working on sustainable solutions that meet the needs of society and the market. Although plastic is a recyclable material, negligence in its disposal and the difficulty in differentiating between types of resin leads many people to consider it harmful to nature.The company recently launched Colorfix Revora CO₂RE, a product born from the vision of creating a positive impact on the planet and, through this, influencing companies and brands to adopt products that promote circularity and sustainability. The Colorfix Revora CO₂RE Carbon Reduced line is the embodiment of this vision, combining materials from various sources, including renewable polymers and recycled materials.Following the circular concept, the entire line is tracked in relation to its carbon footprint, from the extraction of raw materials, transportation, and production, to the company''s exit gate. This entire process uses a methodology based on ISO 14067, aligned with ESG certifications – ESG, which involves social, environmental, and governance practices, and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), which provides proof of compliance with environmental, social, and traceability criteria, as defined by the European Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).“We want major global brands to learn about this important innovation, which is one of the solutions for a more environmentally responsible world, and with it, the industry will have an important ally in this constant quest. And anyone attending the K Fair will have the opportunity to learn more about Revora CO₂RE,” emphasizes the CEO. Revora CO₂RE has 18 different compounds aimed at a wide range of segments, such as packaging, furniture, general parts, single-use products, decks, automobiles, agribusiness, and packaging that does not come into contact with food. Development of an innovative and sustainable solution, with reduced and negative carbon footprints that can be applied to various plastic products; simplifying the determination and choice of sustainable inputs for manufacturing in the processing industry and strengthening the organization''s position as an ally of the environment. In addition, it also allows for closer partnerships with companies that are aligned with the same sustainable purpose and product development using Revora CO₂RE.Service:K Show | October 8-15 in Dusseldorf, Germany.

Supreme Petrochem Ltd.
Supreme Petrochem Ltd. is promoted jointly by The Supreme Industries Ltd., India’s largest plastics processor, and the well diversified R. Raheja Investments Pvt Ltd. 
The Supreme Industries Limited, founded in 1942 has been relevant with the changing times and continues to be a household name solely because of the core values that they uphold.
Raheja Group has multifarious business interests covering cement, ceramic tiles, automotive batteries, cable TV, retail superstores, construction, etc.

Supreme Petrochem Ltd commenced operations in 1995, with a modest polystyrene plant of 66,000 TPA capacity.
Yet, in less than a decade and a half, the company became the undisputed leader in polystyrene in India, with a market share exceeding 50%.
Its installed capacity has grown to 300,000 TPA effectively making SPL one of the largest single location PS producer in Asia. Exports have grown considerably too. Today the company proudly serves customers in more than 100 countries worldwide.
To widen its Styrenics spectrum, SPL forayed into production of EPS at multiple locations. The current installed capacity of EPS stands at 118,000 TPA.

From being a large commodity player, SPL is now increasingly operating as a supplier of value added products.
It has broken new grounds by developing specialty PP compounds for Appliances and Automotive applications. SPL expanded its masterbatch range to include White, Black, Colour, Filler and UV variants with various carrier resins.
Simultaneously SPL in 2007 started India’s first and only integrated plant of XPS (Extruded Polystyrene) Insulation foam boards to support and promote Green Building movement in India and are registered with IGBC and GRIHA.

traceless materials GmbH
traceless materials GmbH is a female-founded bioeconomy startup based in Hamburg, Germany.  With traceless®, we are offering a novel material alternative to conventional plastics and bioplastics.  Based on our innovative, patent-pending technology, we use agricultural industry by-products to produce natural biopolymer materials that provide many beneficial properties of plastics, while being fully bio-circular and sustainable considering all impact indicators.

Even though traceless® is plantbased, naturally compostable and plastic free, it is suitable for many plastic applications and converting technologies. We offer our material as a base material in granulate form, which can be further processed to flexible films, rigid applications, coatings or adhesive solutions with many standard thermoplastic technologies. traceless® can replace plastics and bioplastics in a wide range of use cases – from rigid and flexible packaging to disposables to products with high abrasion and paper coating & adhesive solutions.

Our novel solution is part of a new generation of natural polymer biomaterials, going one decisive step beyond the sustainability of currently available biobased and biodegradable plastics.

It is our mission to jointly realize the biggest possible contribution to tackling global pollution and waste challenges. With traceless®, we enable manufacturers and brand owners to become a part of this mission: By developing innovative plastic-free products from traceless®, they can fulfil sustainability goals, meet legal demands and be at the forefront of innovative green product development.

Frilvam S.p.a.
A company that’s international in scope, but with the heart and customer service of a family-run operation. That’s Frilvam, with 70 years of experience in the coloration and additivization of thermoplastic polymers and, today, an Italian leader in the production of Masterbatches in black, white, in color or with special-effects, and biodegradables, as well as a wide range of additive Masterbatches to meet all the most specific needs.
  
Founded in the first years after World War II, Frilvam, based in northern Italy in Milan, began by marketing neutral and colored thermoplastic resins made by other manufacturers, but soon set up its own plants for the production of sample color products.

The customer service and continuous research and development that characterized its business right from the start quickly turned Frilvam into an important player in the field of technopolymers and charged and colored compounds. With the experience and know-how accumulated over the years, it eventually presented its own line of Masterbatches for thermoplastic resins.

Today, Frilvam is a leader in the Masterbatch sector; technologically advanced, it stands out for a significant flexibility of production which makes it capable of satisfying clients’ every need in the most wide-ranging sectors of application. With its own internal Chemical Lab, its relentless R&D work, and a territorial diversification with the opening of plants in Modena and France, Frilvam founds its business on listening and understanding the needs of its customers, who are always viewed as partners with whom to decide on the most suitable formulations for every specific need.

Our extensive experience, moreover, also allows us to offer our customers support from a normative and legislative standpoint, a service which is customized according to the country in question.

The UNI-EN ISO 9001:2015 certification, belonging to the Nerviano headquarter (soon also available in the other locations), guarantees Frilvam’s quality and the reliability of its products.
But most of all it is customer satisfaction that makes our company proud of its 70 years of activity. An international outlook, but with the heart of a family that’s always committed, every day, to doing the right thing.

The important Plast 2018 fair in Milan provided the perfect occasion to celebrate the company’s 70th anniversary in the best possible way. This is where Frilvam decided to celebrate such a prestigious milestone together with its many customers, publicly unveiling the new logo and launching its  renewed range of products and a catalogue with totally revised graphics and layout.
 
The goal of yesterday, today and tomorrow is to be our customers’ essential partner for the realization of their creative/productive process.

By guaranteeing customers the widest range of products on the market, the highest standards of quality, pre-and post-sale technical assistance, and fast, on-time service, we put ourselves forward not as simple supplier but as a solid partner, a reliable, expert leader in the masterbatch sector.

FKuR Kunststoff GmbH
Plastics care for Future – Let`s keep it in the loop. 


FKuR is a medium-sized, privately held company focusing on the development, production and marketing of high-quality special compounds and the distribution of plastic specialties and recyclates.

We are one of the leading suppliers of bioplastics granulates for flexible packaging solutions and engineering applications.

We at FKuR are convinced that nature itself is the best recycler. That''s why we want to use targeted research and development to create
sustainable materials that on the one hand conserve fossil resources and on the other hand can be easily integrated into the reusable material cycle.

Our customers are our partners, we accompany them throughout the entire project: We recommend the most suitable plastic - be it bio-based, biodegradable or recycled - for the given application or develop an individual compound on request. As we have a broad network of reliable partners at our disposal, we can bring brand owners together with the appropriate processor. During the implementation phase, extensive technical support, including on-site customer support, is a matter of course for us. Finally, we support our customers with marketing-relevant questions within the framework of a successful market launch.

Polyethylene terephthalate, biobased (Bio-PET)
Polyethylene, biobased (Bio', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Terralene® - Tailor-made polyethylene compounds based on renewable raw materials | Eastlon - Bio-PET based on renewable raw materials | „Let’s keep it in the loop“ – sustainable plastic solutions for a circular future | „Plastics care for Future – Let`s keep it in the loop“ – Under this motto, FKuR will present its expanded portfolio of bioplastics and recyclates at K 2025 in Düsseldorf from October 8 to 15. These materials are tailored to meet the requirements of the circular economy and the European Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR).Highlights at booth E48 in Hall 6 include the soil-biodegradable Bio-Flex® N grades for agricultural and farming products, which leave no persistent microplastics behind. In addition, FKuR will showcase an expanded portfolio of high-performance post-consumer recyclates (PCR) and in-house developed recyclate compounds. A new addition is the LDPE recyclate “Paluren” from Palurec (Hürth/Germany), derived from recycled beverage cartons.Visitors will also find numerous product examples made from recyclable, bio-based Terralene® compounds based on bio-PE, as well as from the bio-based I’m green™ biobased PE and EVA grades from Braskem. Bio-based plastics are a key component in the defossilization of the plastics industry and offer sustainable solutions for applications where environmental compatibility is a top priority. Designed for Soil Biodegradability Key features of FKuR’s new Bio-Flex® N series include complete biodegradability in soil and certification according to ‘OK biodegradable SOIL’ by TÜV Austria. Depending on the grade, certification has already been granted or is currently in progress due to the lengthy testing and approval process. The portfolio includes grades for blown film, injection molding, and extrusion, all specifically developed to meet the requirements of agricultural and farming applications. All Bio-Flex® N types degrade in soil without leaving any residue and do not produce persistent microplastics. This makes them especially suitable for products that remain in nature after use or cannot be collected again—such as mulch films, binding twines, and plant clips for vegetables, growth tubes for trees, or drainage pipes in horticulture and agriculture.The already OK biodegradable SOIL-certified Bio-Flex® N 25370 is suitable for injection molding and profile extrusion products such as tree guards and growth tubes used in forestry. Despite its high density, N 25370 offers excellent flexibility.Key applications of the Bio-Flex® blown film grades N 21310 and N 31310 include mulch films as well as plant and net labels. Thanks to its well-balanced property profile, Bio-Flex® N 21310 is a suitable alternative to the industrially compostable grade Bio-Flex® F 1140 when soil biodegradability is desired. In comparison, Bio-Flex® N 31310 offers higher puncture resistance and toughness.Bio-Flex® N 45261 is suitable for injection molding and profile extrusion. Its increased stiffness and strength make it ideal for applications such as clips, plant stakes, and pots. Visually appealing LDPE recyclate from beverage cartons New to FKuR’s distribution program is the plastic recyclate Paluren. This LDPE, available in pellet form, is produced through an innovative recycling process from used beverage cartons (PolyAl) and contains around 4% aluminum flakes. This gives products made from Paluren a unique appearance.The recycling company Palurec employs a mechanical-physical process that uses no organic solvents, with water as the only separation medium. The production of Paluren LDPE meets the requirements of the German VerpackG certification as well as the RecyClass Recycling Process Certificate.Paluren can be processed similarly to conventional PE and allows the use of hot runner injection molding technology as well as common polyolefin-based color and additive masterbatches. It can also be welded and bonded. The aluminum flake content is intentionally utilized to create attractive aesthetic properties. Patrick Zimmermann, Managing Director of FKuR, states: “With the forward-looking motto of our presence at K 2025, we emphasize our ongoing commitment to circularity in the plastics industry. We demonstrate that those seeking pioneering new options for material substitution will find highly attractive solutions at FKuR that meet all regulatory requirements. This applies equally to consumer goods, packaging, and industrial applications. In this way, we help OEMs, suppliers, and processors leverage and deliver greater sustainability to their customers—with our biodegradable or bio-based plastics as well as recyclates—regardless of the industry.”', hall = '6', stand = 'E48', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Melanie Schreurs", "role": "Technical Sales Manager", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Steven Schuitema", "role": "Technical Sales Manager BeNeLux", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Carolin Theunissen", "role": "Business Development Manager", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Niklas Voß", "role": "Associate Sales Director", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Denise Martha", "role": "Head of Marketing", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Sonja Bollig", "role": "Sales Administration", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Yvonne Fliegen", "role": "Sales Administration", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T00:55:45.126391', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

Delta Engineering bv
Delta Engineering was founded in 1992 by Danny De Bruyn and Rudy Lemeire, both engineers active in the production of plastic bottles.
Noticing the lack of efficient leak detection equipment, they started designing and producing the UDK100, a single head leak tester.
In the following months and years, they stayed very much attuned to the needs of their customers, leading quickly to the development of a whole range of solutions solving the actual problems of today companies.
This hands-on approach enabled Delta Engineering to establish a preeminent position in the industry. Today Delta Engineering counts large multinational groups, as well as smaller independently owned companies among its customers.

Licharz GmbH
We research, develop and manufacture for you
INNOVATIONS: since 1962

We are specialized in the production of semi-finished products made of engineering plastics. Our main focus is the production of LiNNOTAM, a very strong, durable cast polyamide from our own development. POM and PET complete our program. Over 7000 tons of engineering plastics per year - that is our volume. We are among the top manufacturers worldwide.

Long-lasting materials, individual cuts, variety in dimensions - these are the top priorities here. Incidentally, the art of polyamide and semifinished product production lies in good formulations and precisely adapted
Production plants. That''s why, for us, recipe development and plant setup go hand in hand.

The engineering plastics PA, POM and PET are innovative substitutes for metals because they are wear-resistant, easy to glide and easy to machine. It''s no wonder, then, that they are now the starting product for a wide variety of parts and components in mechanical engineering and industrial

Where today construction crane, conveyor technology or food processing is on it, not rarely Licharz is in it.
At our company headquarters in Buchholz in the Westerwald region, we are the second generation to develop formulations for engineering plastics and manufacture semi-finished products and structural parts for a wide variety of industries and markets.

TOPLINE MK2 - Modular high-pressure metering machines of the next generation for the most demanding and highly automated special applications
HIGHLINE MK2 - ', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | PANELMASTER STEEL - Turnkey plant technology for the continuous production of sandwich panels with rigid facings and a core structure made of polyurethane or mineral wool | Hennecke GROUP at the K Trade Fair 2025: Innovative solutions drive FOCUS2030 strategy forward | From October 8 to 15, 2025, the Hennecke GROUP will showcase its role as a leading innovation driver in the polyurethane industry at the K Trade Fair in Düsseldorf (Hall 13/ BoothB63). At the heart of the presentation: the new FOCUS2030 corporate strategy and a portfolio of cutting-edge technologies that set new benchmarks in efficiency, sustainability, and digitalization. FOCUS2030: Strategic roadmap for sustainable growthFollowing a record-breaking year in 2024, the Hennecke GROUP is entering its next growth phase with the launch of FOCUS2030. This long-term strategy emphasizes responsible business practices, targeted expansion, technological excellence, and a globally oriented organizational structure with specialized competence centers and integrated system solutions that follow a tailor-made Local-for-Local approach. “With FOCUS2030, we are actively shaping change and aligning our business model with the customer demands of the future,” says Thomas Wildt, CEO of the Hennecke GROUP. Technological highlights: Innovation meets sustainabilityFor Hennecke, responsible business means conserving resources and maximizing efficiency. Since the last K Trade Fair, more than 25 new and further developments in the Hennecke GROUP''s product portfolio impressively embody this philosophy. The focus of the trade fair presentation is on four new product generations that demonstrate how technological innovation contributes directly to sustainability and economic performance. The new SMARTFLEX evo continuous slabstock line bridges the gap between JFLEX evo and MULTIFLEX, offering a high-performance, cost-effective entry into large-scale comfort foam production. Its modular design and high degree of standardization significantly reduce investment and operating costs, while proven high-pressure metering technology ensures efficient raw material usage.  In the automated production of energy-efficient insulation using rigid PUR foam, the new HIGHLINE MK2 TI SERIES high-pressure metering machine enables faster, more precise mould filling and reliable processing of blowing agents such as pentane and modern flammable and non-flammable HFO formulations. This significantly improves process and product quality as well as cycle times, especially when using highly reactive and demanding rigid foam systems. As part of the Local-for-Local approach of the FOCUS2030 strategy, the machine is offered worldwide with identical performance data, but its technical design is specifically adapted to the respective market requirements. This flexibility makes the TI SERIES particularly appealing to global customers, especially in rapidly growing Asian markets. A version already available for the APAC region underscores this impressively. The all-electric PANELMASTER STEEL sets new standards in sandwich panel production, with a capacity of up to 2,000,000 square meters per year. The newly developed MiWo concept for mineral wool processing establishes a new global benchmark. The ECOFILLER PLUS MK2 represents a major step toward waste-free production. This system enables the efficient recycling of production waste directly into the manufacturing process of PUR sandwich elements, conserving valuable resources and reducing environmental impact. Digitalization as a key technologyAll new product generations are equipped with the advanced FOAMATIC and FOAMWARE control solutions. FOAMATIC combines a modern HMI with a powerful PLC and enables particularly simple and error-free operation thanks to its intuitive “three-click philosophy.” As a PC-based solution, FOAMWARE offers maximum transparency in continuous processes, especially in industrial environments with large data volumes and high demands. Both systems actively contribute to resource conservation and increased efficiency. Service and retrofittingIn addition to new technologies, Hennecke will present its comprehensive 360°SERVICE portfolio at the K Trade Fair. This includes the 360°SMART Service Portal and a range of innovative retrofit solutions that allow customers worldwide to modernize existing systems and significantly boost efficiency. Another highlight is the new service consulting under 360°ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, which provides expert guidance on process optimization and production reliability. Visitors can also learn more about the newly available FOAMWARE Complete Care service package. This modular offering gives slabstock producers maximum predictability and production reliability, aligning seamlessly with the 360°SERVICE philosophy. The goal: smooth production operations and long-term partnerships. Digital machine configuration with the #nextgenstoreWith the new online configurator NEXT-GEN Store, Hennecke becomes the first supplier worldwide to offer the possibility of configuring PUR metering machines individually and according to requirements - conveniently online or as a special highlight directly at the Hennecke trade fair stand. Under the motto "Your Machine. Your Configuration. Live at K Show", visitors will experience how easily and quickly a suitable solution can be put together for many possible application scenarios. The intuitive web interface enables quick configuration and immediately shows the current delivery times for all available markets. Curious visitors can even create their personal configuration before the trade fair at hennecke.com/configurator, note down the configuration code and find out directly at the booth why placing an order at the K Trade Fair is twice as worthwhile.  The Hennecke experts are looking forward to showing visitors customized solutions at the K 2025 Trade Fair. Visit booth B63 in hall 13 to find out more about how we can shape the future of the polyurethane industry together.   About HenneckeThe core brands of the Hennecke GROUP have been developing pioneering systems and technologies for polyurethane processing for 80 years.

EFLAYA SRL
We were born from the union of different companies and experiences, from the history of market leaders such as Sovere (since 1976 in PVC) and CM Manzoni (since 1965), a leading company in vulcanized rubber, to part of the former Softer Management .eflaya is the result of various aggregation initiatives, both mergers and acquisitions (e.g. with Sol Termoplasticos in Mexico ) and joint ventures (e.g. with Montelur in Uruguay) and actual start-ups (e.g. the TPE plant in Fusignano, Italy). Eflaya is also a synergistic and unified brand.

Our goal is to quickly become a "pocket-sized multinational", with a global presence in strategic locations for compound production and local distribution, while maintaining the flexibility and responsiveness typical of an SME.

Our production spectrum ranges from TPE (with SBS , SEBS , TPV), TPU to PVC . The ability to produce customized materials with polymer alloys based on specific customer requirements enables us to comprehensively cover the most diverse and specialized requirements.
Eflaya goes beyond the simple sales offer and presents itself as a solution provider able to develop the most suitable product together with the customer after understanding and analyzing their needs.

Complete DUROPLAST service
Advice, support and training in theory and practice
Design, thermal analysis
Sampling in our own technical centre, process optimization, problem solving

Plastics engineering and development partner
Material characterization in our own laboratory
Creation of extended technical data sheets and simulation maps
Simulations (mold flow, temperature control, FEA) and feasibility studies

specific marketing for technical services and products - targeted, plannable, effective
Increased findability + precise search engine optimization (SEO),
better ranking with existing websites
Improvement of company image (corporate CI, graphic styles / design)
Creation of sales material (presentations, flyers, print data)
Help with new customer acquisition (lead generation, performance marketing)
new websites / help with LinkedIn / activate sales channels
Process and product photography specifically for the plastics industry

Marketing support from A to Z, project-based and permanent support possible.


Schwarz Plastic Solutions is a team of three specialists with many years of experience, each with a different focus on specific topics that often cause difficulties in our industry.


Two of our experts are active as external technical support and problem solvers for thermosets and engineering thermoplastics. Decades of experience from injection molding production and scientific work come together here.
With our own modern injection molding technical center and laboratory, we are available to OEMs, TIERs, material manufacturers and plastics processors alike as a partner and "external team extension" with very specific knowledge.

typical topics for which we provide technical assistance:
Setting up injection molding production / transitioning prototypes to series production
Introduction of a new technology
Material development / component development
Training of specialists in production (training - coaching - education)
Problems with process or component quality in injection molding (thermoset / engineering thermoplastics)



Our third team member helps with commercial problems with a broad portfolio of technical marketing support and highly targeted actions. Marketing does not work without specialist knowledge of processes / technologies / applications and, on the other hand, knowledge of target groups and their interests or problems. This is exactly where we come in and offer the mix that makes complex technical topics appealing and addresses your target group in the right way.


typical topics that we help with in marketing:
if the external appearance or presence in the market has been neglected or is not working
if the website does not bring the desired success / visits / contacts
if there is no internal marketing and external agencies from outside the industry only cost a lot of money and bring nothing
if there are too few new customer inquiries



Despite a strong focus on reactive polymers and a specific portfolio of services, thanks to a long-standing network within the industry, we can also provide support for topics that at first glance do not fall within our core area. Talk to us and we will find a solution.

So please bring your problem to the K trade fair in Hall 7a, Stand B25-01 - we will be happy to help you.

NIPPON TALC CO., LTD.
Founded in 1934, Nippon Talc Co., Ltd. has supported global industries for over 90 years as a specialized manufacturer of mineral fillers. Our high-quality talc and other mineral-based fillers are used in plastics, rubber, coatings, adhesives, electronic materials, cosmetics, and food additives. With five production facilities in Japan, China, Thailand, and Pakistan, we ensure global supply of identical specifications and stable quality. Today, Nippon Talc products are trusted by customers in more than 37 countries worldwide.
At K2025, we are highlighting our latest innovations that combine sustainability and high performance. One of our newest developments is the KUROTALC Series, designed specifically for black-colored plastics. Traditionally, adding white talc to black resins caused greying and loss of appearance quality. KUROTALC maintains deep black coloration while providing talc’s reinforcement benefits, and it can partially replace carbon black to achieve cost reduction. This innovation is ideal for automotive interiors, home appliances, and other black applications requiring both aesthetics and functionality.
Another breakthrough is the TKD Scallop Powder Series, representing our commitment to circular economy and CO₂ reduction. Derived from scallop shells and produced without the traditional calcination process, TKD achieves significant CO₂ savings. With a mild pH of 9.3 compared to 13.4 for calcined products, it improves workplace safety, while odor and chlorine are removed for clean handling. With more than 96% purity in CaCO₃, TKD provides superior bending modulus and toughness compared to limestone-derived fillers. It offers broad application potential in plastics, rubber, coatings, detergents, and deodorants.
In the field of flame retardants, we present Magnesium Hydroxide (Mg(OH)₂), a halogen-free inorganic solution. Upon heating, it decomposes endothermically to release water vapor, cooling the material, diluting flammable gases, and reducing smoke generation significantly. Synthetic grades with ≥98% purity deliver excellent dispersibility, while natural grades provide cost efficiency. Optional stearic acid and silane treatments further enhance dispersion and compatibility with resins such as PE, PP, PVC, and EVA. Importantly, Mg(OH)₂ also demonstrates strong suitability for recycled plastics, supporting sustainable material cycles in line with global regulations.
We also highlight the Nano Ace Series, an ultrafine talc with established applications in nucleating agents and electronic adhesives. As a nucleating agent, Nano Ace accelerates crystallization in PP and PET, enabling shorter molding cycles and improved stiffness and dimensional stability. In electronic adhesives, it delivers thixotropy control, improved cohesive strength, and shrinkage resistance. Emerging studies also report excellent effects in PLA-based 3D printing, such as reduced warpage, improved rigidity, and higher thermal stability. This positions Nano Ace as both a proven solution and a promising material for next-generation applications.
Through these developments, Nippon Talc continues to innovate as a leading global mineral filler manufacturer, offering solutions that balance performance with environmental responsibility. At K2025, we invite you to explore our full product portfolio—from sustainable fillers and halogen-free flame retardants to next-generation additives for adhesives, nucleation, and 3D printing. With a robust global network and five production bases, we deliver consistent quality, reliable supply, and technologies that support a sustainable future.

Torimex Group Sp z o.o.
Torimex Group Sp. z o.o. has been founded in the city of Lodz in 1994.

Many years of successful business activity have solidified our position on both the domestic and foreign markets as a distributor of raw materials and products mainly for the rubber and plastic industry as well as adhesives. It allowed us, however, also for further development in other branches, which is why now we offer not only numerous chemicals, but also Gibitre Instruments’ laboratory equipment for the rubber industry.

Our co-operation with the world’s biggest chemical corporations permitted us to ensure the highest quality of all the items in our portfolio throughout the years. Basing our activity on partnership relations with both suppliers and end users we are able to conduct mutually beneficial business. Our goal is to offer not only professional trade services but also, based on long-term experience, technological support and solutions that guarantee a steady rise in competitiveness.

We own a specialized class A warehouse that provides the highest security and appropriate storing conditions.
Adhering to ISO 9001:2015 standards and procedures of waste management allows us to meet even the most strict quality, security and environmental requirements.

Futerro S.A.
Innovating for a Sustainable Tomorrow
 At Futerro, we are not just a company; we are pioneers leading the change towards a sustainable future. Established in 1992, we have been at the forefront of the bioplastics industry, revolutionising the production and development of Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA), also known as Futeon™ PLA.

Our commitment to innovation has made PLA a recognised and viable alternative to traditional petro-based plastics now used across a wide range of applications.

Shaping the Future
 Futeon™ is not just any polymer: it reflects our commitment to sustainable alternatives to conventional oil-based plastics.

A legacy of Innovation
 Recognised as a beacon of progress, Futerro stands tall as one of the most advanced entities in the biotechnology and chemical sectors.

With over 30 years of relentless pursuit of excellence, we have developed cutting-edge technologies and processes that encompass the entire PLA lifecycle, securing over 300 patents in the process. 

Closing the Loop with Loopla™

Futerro is proud to provide a truly circular economy solution. Our patented Loopla™ technology is a game-changer, enabling us to convert end-of-life PLA-based products into lactic acid with very high yield.

This breakthrough allows us to produce pristine Futeon™, closing the loop on waste and setting a new standard for end-of-life management.

PLA (polylactic acid, Polymilchsäure)
All pr', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Futerro unveils Futeon™: a new chapter for sustainable solutions | Futerro S.A., a Belgian company specialising in the production of lactic acid, lactide (two platform biomolecules), and PLA (polylactic acid), announces the rebranding of its product line from RENEW™ to Futeon™, a step that reflects its commitment to modernisation, innovation, and long-term sustainability. A New Brand Expression for a Future-Driven Vision The transition from RENEW™ to Futeon™ signals a renewed energy behind Futerro’s mission to lead in sustainable innovation. With this modernised identity, the company strengthens the visibility of its flagship PLA product line and lays the groundwork for future milestones, including the launch of its fully integrated biorefinery in France.  Futeon™, which can be interpreted etymologically as “the era of the future,” embodies the innovative and forward-thinking spirit that has shaped Futerro’s journey for more than 30 years. It also reflects the company’s commitment to delivering sustainability and resilience through its products, which are designed to offer meaningful solutions for today and the future. The rebranding introduces a new logo for Futeon™, accompanied by a refreshed visual identity and the launch of a new website for Futerro. While the name evolves, the essence remains unchanged: Futeon™ continues to reflect Futerro’s drive for innovation, its dedication to environmental responsibility, and the high-performance PLA solutions that remain central to customer innovation and sustainable development.  Same Products, Stronger Identity Effective immediately, all products previously marketed, distributed, or sold under the RENEW® brand will now carry the Futeon™ brand name. Products themselves remain unchanged, maintaining the same composition, specifications, performance, quality, manufacturing processes, certifications, and regulatory compliance, but now presented under a revitalised brand identity that reflects Futerro’s forward-looking vision. Futeon™ marks an exciting turning point for Futerro, setting the stage for expanded global reach, greater impact, and a renewed drive to shape a more sustainable future. | Exhibitors & Products | Digital Services Act (DSA)', hall = '5', stand = 'D04-05', logo_url = 'https://www.futerro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LogoFuterro.png', logo_file = 'logos/logo_Futerro_SA.png', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Frédéric VAN GANSBERGHE", "role": "Chief Executive Officer", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T01:01:40.902577', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

Polyviny', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Products made by extrusion | Electrical and Electronic Equipment Recycling: How to Enhance Plastic Effectiveness | The European Commission is currently revising the regulation concerning Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Although this directive has been in place for 20 years and has shown some progress, it has not been completely effective, with only 40% of WEEE being recycled across the European Union.The evaluation focuses on several key targets: enhancing the collection of critical raw materials,improving recycling rates,harmonizing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR),and improving waste treatment processes.Additionally, electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) will also be affected by the upcoming Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR).Plastic is a significant component of EEEIt serves various functions, including structural parts (casings, housings, panels, and trays), cables, and electronic components (connectors, switches, displays, and bezels), as well as mechatronic parts (actuators and gears). The types of plastics used include polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polystyrene (PS) for structural applications, and technical polymers (such as polyamide [PA], polyether ether ketone [PEEK], polyoxymethylene [POM], polyphenylene sulfide [PPS], and polybutylene terephthalate [PBT]) for other components. This variety presents significant challenges in post-consumer sorting, which is necessary for efficient reintegration into new products. While sorting methods such as spectroscopic, electrostatic, and differential density techniques are quite effective, the predominance of black plastics in many parts can hinder reuse due to their color balance.Structural parts, however, present the most promising opportunity for improvement, as they represent a significant volume and are essential for enhancing collection and reintegration into new products. Their recyclability and availability make them a key pillar in the shift towards sustainable plastics for EEE. Nevertheless, challenges remain, particularly regarding certain plastic types that may contain legacy additives. The life cycle of EEE generally spans a medium range of 3 to 10 years, depending on the product type. Additives such as halogenated flame retardants could pose obstacles to achieving full circularity, which upcoming recycling processes must address through extraction techniques. Therefore, the goal of achieving full circularity remains a challenge, although post-consumer reintegration can be improved.Benvic is currently developing a solution for EEE utilizing post-consumer recycled content, mainly focusing on PP compounds. The two key challenges are ensuring material performance and managing costs. The goal of compounding is to source and qualify proper post-consumer feedstock. Additionally, qualifying this feedstock is essential to enable recompounding and produce a high-quality product.Given the variety of compounds to be used and their applications, co-design with customers is crucial to manage the necessary adaptations depending on EEE components. Collaborating with designers for the evolution of part characteristics, particularly for major appliances and transparent parts, is vital. Establishing injection parameters and characteristics is another important step to ensure final quality and cost control.We invite you to meet us in Düsseldorf at the K2025 show to discuss your EEE part project focused on recycling.Let''s discuss about it during the K2025 show in Düsseldorf, we are in Hall 8a – Stand F12. | The upcoming End-of-Life Vehicle Regulation (ELVR) poses a significant challenge for automakers and manufacturers of automotive plastic parts. Within the next few years, all plastic components must contain a share of post-consumer recycled plastics, with a portion sourced from former vehicles. While details are still being discussed between the European Council and the European Parliament regarding the specifics and the required amount of recycled content, a clearer perspective is emerging. Introducing post-consumer recyclates into plastics is not a straightforward process, as it involves several challenges. One major concern is the recycling process itself. While mechanical recycling is generally more efficient in terms of life cycle analysis (LCA), it imposes technical restrictions based on the intended application. Issues such as color, odor, emissions, and impurities—attributes that are currently not accepted—may arise in the next generation of plastics. Although some advanced sorting and predictive techniques are being developed to address these challenges, none are yet widely implemented at an industrial scale. 3 Key Challenges Ahead  1. Circularity of Plastics The primary challenge relates to the circularity of plastics in the automotive industry. The incoming feedstock comes from vehicles dismantled over the last two decades, where cost, reliability, and performance were the chief engineering priorities. Unfortunately, recyclability was not a consideration at that time. Elements such as painted plastics, metalized coatings, and two-component (2K) molding present significant hurdles for recycling. Additionally, changes in vehicle design and aesthetics raise questions about material reintegration. For example, the shift from red to clear tail light lenses leads to reintegration challenges. Even the engineering sector is now adopting best practices to improve materials'' recyclability, but adapting strategies for integrating recycled content from past productions will take time. 2. Quality Assurance The second challenge involves maintaining quality. The automotive industry has established best practices to ensure that complex systems like vehicles remain reliable for at least a decade. These practices focus on production process management to achieve predictable performance. However, incorporating post-consumer recyclate introduces variability and non-repeatability into the mix. Suppliers must disclose any changes in post-consumer recyclate sources used in their materials, non really possible with recycling activities. This integration requires a reevaluation of both design and production standards.  3. Supply Chain Collaboration The third challenge lies in aligning the entire supply chain to prioritize recycled content in plastics and adjusting relationships accordingly. Currently, a top-down approach has been employed, with rules originating from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and flowing down to systems, components, and materials suppliers. To gain better control over the supply chain, collaborative relationships are essential. This includes engaging vehicle dismantlers, plastic recyclers, and all stakeholders together to establish new practices that optimize the use of recycled plastics in terms of cost, technical performance, quality, and environmental impact. Finding Solutions TogetherWhile the ELVR mandate is approaching, not everything will be perfect initially. As a compounder, Benvic is committed to developing new plastic solutions by incorporating post-consumer recycled plastics. Different strategies will be adopted depending on the application. A straightforward approach is to substitute a fraction of post-consumer recycled material into our existing plastic formulations, particularly for polyolefins like polypropylene (PP) compounds. Benvic plans to release a basic range of such products soon. Alternatively, a more innovative approach could capitalize on the availability of feedstock from various segments with stable properties to develop new plastics. Given the reduction of single-use plastics, the packaging industry will yield a certain amount of polymers, which allows for the design of new formulations tailored for specific functions. This requires close collaboration between compounders, OEMs, and other stakeholders regarding part design and processability to create the next generation of materials that balance cost-performance with minimized resource usage. Benvic will be present at the K2025 fair in Düsseldorf from October 8-15, 2025. We invite you to visit our stand in Hall 8A-F12, where we will share innovative ideas for new automotive polymers, driven by our commitment to redesigning plastics.

Bioplastics, cellulose', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | GRAFE expands its proven service for OEMs and design partners outside the automotive industryIn today''s digital age, are physical reference samples still necessary?This question arises time and again in an era of digital color models, simulations, and 3D renderings. But in the reality of long development processes and complex value chains, the answer is clear: Yes, absolutely. Physical master samples remain indispensable! On the one hand, they serve as a feasibility analysis for implementing the OEM''s color requirements in polymer, and on the other hand, they provide a defined color concept and reference for the color and gloss level of various plastic parts at the supplier. They enable precise and consistent evaluation of components across all stages of the production chain, regardless of screen displays, lighting conditions, or subjective impressions.OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and ODMs (original design manufacturers) in particular, who value high color precision, use these haptic reference samples, which are made available to the parts manufacturer. To adjust the colors of different plastic components and match them in color matching – primarily in the mobility sector, such as automotive engineering, aviation, rail, and shipbuilding. But there are also OEM structures in medical technology and in the electrical and household appliance sectors that need to ensure design consistency. This is not just a matter for the suppliers or parts manufacturers themselves, but also for the companies that have a decisive influence on color design and material selection, are responsible for these decisions, and guarantee them across all instances.GRAFE – an experienced partner for master sample sheets for over 20 yearsThe GRAFE Group, based in Blankenhain, has been an established partner for OEMs and their design departments for two decades. The masterbatch and compound specialist supports customers from the initial color idea to the finished reference sample. What began as a service primarily for the automotive sector is now a comprehensive range of individual services that, in addition to the actual production of master samples, covers expert advice on all aspects of color development – whether it''s choosing the degree of gloss, the grain, or selecting suitable carrier materials and packaging."Our master samples are not only used in the automotive sector. We are increasingly receiving inquiries from other industries that depend on maximum color accuracy and reproducibility,“ explains Lars Schulze, Head of Color Development and Material Sciences, adding: ”GRAFE typically produces between 300 and 600 master sample plates per color development – with high consistency, the tightest tolerances, and long-term color stability. This is real added value for brands with long-term product and manufacturing cycles."Comprehensive master sample service – smooth and preciseGRAFE''s master sample service is based on a structured, tried-and-tested process that requires close cooperation with OEMs and ODMs, thereby enabling successful color development.The first step is careful project planning so that the desired grain and surface structure can be selected in the next step, which serves as the basis for tool design. Based on digital color values or physical color templates, such as paint samples, fabric or leather samples, and even metal elements, GRAFE''s colorists then develop a precise color formula for the substrate material used. The desired color tone is then provided to the OEM as a sample plate for further iteration loops in order to fine-tune the color until approval is granted. The final production of the master sample plates takes place under the highest quality standards.Depending on customer requirements, visual and metrological checks are carried out on a random basis or for each individual sample. Colorimetric measurement and documentation complete the quality assurance process. The labeled and packaged master sample plates are then sent to the OEM/ODM or – as GRAFE services – directly to Tier 1 or Tier 2 suppliers, as desired. In addition to the main service of solid-colored master sample plates, special solutions such as paintable samples with a structured surface are also available.Indispensable reference – with added value from a single sourceDespite times of accelerated product development with high design demands, haptic samples are not losing their importance as a binding reference. They enable reliable assessment under real conditions and accompany projects over many years. GRAFE not only supplies the reference sample, but can also offer the right material for subsequent series production – a perfect symbiosis. The masterbatch and compound specialist GRAFE stands for competence, precision, and passion from the initial idea to the perfect reference. | Color variety for biodegradable plastics – sustainable, certified and design-orientedBiodegradable plastics play a key role in sustainable product development – especially where mechanical recycling is technically difficult or economically unfeasible. With its BIOCOLEN ® product range, GRAFE, based in Blankenhain, offers a tailor-made solution for precisely these areas of application: individually colored, biodegradable plastics that are not only compostable but also meet high aesthetic and functional requirements.Unlike traditional polymer types, which are increasingly required by law to be recycled, the masterbatches and compounds in the BIOCOLEN® range are inherently designed to be degradable, offering a forward-looking option for products with a limited service life. Examples range from packaging and disposable products to hygiene articles. BIOCOLEN® combines ecological responsibility with technical feasibility and design freedom.Certified sustainability – with expert supportA key unique selling point of GRAFE is the comprehensive support it offers its customers – not only in material selection and coloring, but also in the complex certification process. The company provides targeted support for the development of compostable plastic products right through to the award of renowned quality seals for end products, including ‘OK compost HOME’, ‘OK compost INDUSTRIAL’ and ‘OK biodegradable’ from TÜV Austria. These internationally recognised labels stand for proven environmentally friendly disposal – whether in domestic compost or under industrial conditions. Although GRAFE does not carry out the actual certification itself, it has been working closely with the responsible testing agency for many years. This proven partnership and direct exchange enable a particularly efficient and smooth process.Right from the development phase, GRAFE ensures that all ingredients used in the manufacture of its BIOCOLEN® masterbatches and compounds meet the requirements of the respective certification, both in terms of selection and dosage. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that the colorants do not adversely affect the testing of the end product. Particular emphasis is placed on selecting suitable pigments, especially with regard to compliance with the strict heavy metal limits specified in DIN EN 13432. Before delivery, comprehensive tests are carried out in the company''s own analytical laboratory in order to identify potential problems at an early stage and avoid unnecessary iteration steps – which also saves time and money.GRAFE offers PHBV and PLA, among other things, as carrier materials. Alternatively, customers can provide their own polymers to test their suitability as carriers and thus ensure the highest possible material purity in the end product.Functionality meets design – even with biodegradable materialsContrary to the widespread misconception that biodegradable plastics are visually or technically limited, GRAFE proves the opposite with BIOCOLEN®. The company''s color experts apply a wide range of colors, including soft pastel shades and signal colors, to biodegradable substrates. Thanks to innovative formulations, optical effects can also be achieved without compromising compostability. This design freedom opens up new possibilities for differentiated brand identities in the sustainability segment.Additives for application-specific requirementsIn addition to color design, GRAFE also offers a targeted selection of additives for BIOCOLEN ® products, always taking into account biodegradability and the desired certification. This significantly expands the range of applications and makes BIOCOLEN ® a versatile masterbatch solution for a wide variety of industries.Bio-based but not biodegradable: the TEKOLEN range as a logical additionIn addition to classic petrochemical polymers, the GRAFE TEKOLEN ® product range also includes bio-based plastics that are not biodegradable. This alternative can be used for durable products that are deliberately not compostable but are made from sustainably produced polymers. Here too, GRAFE naturally offers comprehensive options for coloring and functional additives – tailored to the respective target application and process control.Conclusion: Sustainable plastic solutions with a systemWith BIOCOLEN ® and TEKOLEN ® , GRAFE addresses the key challenges of sustainable plastics processing. Thanks to its in-depth expertise, broad understanding of materials and strong commitment to service, the company supports its customers from the initial idea to the market-ready solution – always with the aim of combining innovation, environmental protection and design at the highest level. | GRAFE revises standard black portfolio for 3D printing 3D printing has undergone rapid development in recent years and now characterises numerous industries. To this end, the Thuringian company GRAFE, based in Blankenhain, is enriching the market with customer-specific colourings and expanding its standard range alongside the RAL K7 fan and customer-specific colour settings in all common thermoplastics in this area. Three new standard black variants have been added, which are among the most important materials in 3D printing and are suitable for numerous applications. "Our aim is to meet customer requirements even faster and to cover a wide range of customer requirements with the predefined range," says Lars Schulze, Head of Colour Development and Material Sciences. "Our years of project work have shown that we not only need high-performance materials and excellent colour settings, but also fast and cost-efficient solutions," the specialist continues.The Schwarz portfolio now includes three masterbatches with the carrier materials PETG and PLA. In addition to the classic PLA variant, an additional option is offered that meets the strict requirements with FDA approval for food contact. Established processes and a universal formulation, which does not require any customisation, enable cost-efficient production and rapid provision of standard batches. This allows a particularly competitive and attractive offer to be realised in the GRAFE range. "In contrast to classic UN substrates, we also want to give our customers who demand the highest quality the option of selecting a substrate that matches the print material. This eliminates compromises in terms of layer adhesion, warping or flow properties. We also offer our customers this service for our standard colour range," says Schulze PETG - Robust and versatile Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) combines stability with flexibility and is extremely resistant to mechanical stress and moisture. The material is also characterised by high impact strength, temperature and weather resistance and low shrinkage. These properties make PETG ideal for the production of robust components, prototypes and end products. It is also ideal for technical applications, housings and functional components that require high durability. PETG is favoured by engineers, designers and private users due to its excellent printability and strong layer adhesion and is also suitable for a wide range of industrial applications.  PLA - Sustainable and biodegradable Polylactide (PLA) is a bio-based plastic material made from renewable raw materials such as corn starch or sugar cane. It is characterised by low moisture absorption and simplified storage. PLA also has good mechanical properties, such as high surface hardness, rigidity and high tensile strength. Due to its environmental friendliness and ease of processing for industrial and private applications, PLA is a versatile material that is ideal for modelling, product design and decorative items. "PLA and PETG are the most popular materials in 3D printing and are valued both in industry and by hobby users," explains Schulze. Further colour variants and optimised formulations will follow this year. "Our customers benefit from high-quality colour masterbatches in accordance with international standards and can even obtain selected standard items from stock at short notice," says Schulze. | Thanks to special processes and sample boxes, customers save development time with GRAFE Using a special process, the GRAFE GROUP, Blankenhain, is able to test and simulate color ideas for multilayer applications as early as the development phase. "In this way, we achieve results faster for material designs in this area and can optimize the development time for individually tailored products for the benefit of our customers," explains Lars Schulze, Head of Color Development and Material Sciences.Multilayer applications are widely used in the packaging and pharmaceutical industries to protect products from environmental influences and extend their shelf life. In the furniture industry or for high-quality consumer goods, laminates are a cost-effective alternative that achieves a high-quality surface appearance - with minimal use of effect pigments."The carrier material in the base color, in combination with the applied effect carrier, saves through-dyed plastic," explains Schulze. A decorative film, which carries expensive effect pigments for the look, is combined with the inexpensive solid-colored base material, which ensures the stability of the product," adds the expert. "This combination consisting of a base layer and a translucent effect layer enables unique color effects that cannot be achieved with monochrome coloring, or only at very high cost."The challenge in developing the color design lies in the dosage of pigments in the top layer in combination with the appearance of the substrate material. "With our technology, corresponding color ideas can be tested cost-effectively and simulated in-house, which saves the customer time, material and machine set-up costs and therefore also costs during product development," reports Schulze.With specially developed sample profiles, GRAFE offers its customers a service that allows them to get an impressive picture in advance. "With the help of four basic colors, from white to gray to black gradations, we have applied different effect variants. Due to the multi-layer structure, they illustrate the depth effect achieved by layering," says the color developer, pointing out that the top layer can also be equipped with the desired properties, additives or aggregates. Every individual color development is included in our development service.""A sample box with a collection of sample PETG tiles is available for customer consultation. The plates, which are the size of a credit card, are based on the GRAFE 2024/25 color trends. In view of the wide range of possible applications in the film and sheet industry, other plastics are also conceivable," Schulze adds. The company is also looking forward to inquiries and close cooperation with industry partners from a wide range of sectors for a variety of other decorative effects.', hall = '6', stand = 'A63', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Sebastian Grafe", "role": "Head Of Sales", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Steffen Schubert", "role": "Head Of Sales D-A-CH", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Florian Ludwig", "role": "Head Of Sales Export", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Lars Schulze", "role": "Head of Color Development and Material Sciences", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Dr. Carlos Juan Caro", "role": "Compounds & Rotomoulding Unit (HD Kunststoffe GmbH)", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Anja Zimmermann", "role": "Public Relations (PR)", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Manfred Fischer", "role": "Head Of Marketing", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T01:05:33.344877', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

ERE Kunststoff RAM-Extrusion GmbH & Co. KG Kelberg
Founded in 1983 by Herbert Mayer, the company initially focused on the production of semi-finished products made of UHMW-PE using the RAM extrusion process. At the same time, the company also processed unmixed plastic production rejects in injection molding and extrusion quality.

After RAM extrusion was discontinued and due to the company''s own need for tools and the wear of screws and barrels, the production of screws, barrels and machine components as well as the compounding of plastics were continuously expanded into efficient, customer- and future-oriented divisions.

In addition to the main factory and ... | MuCell Microcellular Foaming Technology: The Optimal Solution for Lightweighting and Sustainable Manufacturing | MuCell technology has been widely applied in industries such as automotive, electronics, medical, sporting goods, and green manufacturing. Under the growing trends of lightweighting and carbon reduction, it has become a major breakthrough in sustainable and efficient manufacturing. Particularly in the transportation and bicycle industries, MuCell offers lightweighting solutions that reduce plastic usage while enhancing product strength and durability—further lowering carbon footprints.Overview of MuCell Technology MuCell (Microcellular Injection Molding) technology  was developed in the 1980s by Professor Nam P. Suh and his research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and commercialized in the 1990s. The core of MuCell technology lies in using Supercritical Fluid (SCF) techniques to inject carbon dioxide (CO₂) or nitrogen (N₂) into molten plastic to form a uniform microcellular structure. This process reduces material consumption, lowers product weight, and improves both product performance and processing efficiency.Development History of MuCell Technology1980s – Concept Formation and Initial ResearchThe research team at MIT developed a Supercritical Fluid (SCF) process that injected CO₂ or N₂ as physical blowing agents into molten polymers, forming a uniform microcellular structure.The initial aim was to reduce material usage while enhancing mechanical properties such as dimensional stability and warpage control.1990s – Industrial Applications and Patent DevelopmentMIT''s research outcomes led to the commercialization of MuCell technology, and the establishment of Trexel, Inc., which specialized in promoting the technology and developing dedicated equipment.Trexel began applying MuCell technology to sectors such as automotive, electronics, and medical devices, and obtained numerous patents covering gas control systems, mold design, and injection molding process optimization.Post-2000s – Global Expansion and Technology OptimizationAs the technology matured, MuCell gained acceptance in European and Asian markets. Driven by demands for automotive lightweighting (to reduce fuel consumption) and sustainable energy (to reduce plastic usage), many companies adopted this solution.To meet various application needs, MuCell technology further evolved to include:High-precision foaming control (for 3C products and precision manufacturing)Hybrid foaming techniques (to improve stiffness and mechanical strength)Recent Years – Smart Manufacturing and SustainabilityMuCell technology has been integrated into smart manufacturing (e.g., Industry 4.0), enhancing process stability through data monitoring and automation.The development of MuCell is no longer limited to reducing plastic use and maintaining part rigidity. New applications are emerging, such as ultra-lightweight, high-rebound shoe midsoles, noise-reducing, insulating, cold-retaining industrial products, and biomimetic medical applications.Many companies are combining MuCell technology with recyclable plastics to further improve sustainability—for example, by using bio-based or recycled materials to reduce carbon footprints. Figure: MuCell Application in Footwear Midsoles MuCell Molding ProcessCompared with traditional injection molding, MuCell adds an extra step where a supercritical fluid is injected. The detailed steps are as follows:Step 1: Plastic Melting – Thermoplastics (such as PP, ABS, PC) are melted inside the injection machine, forming a hot viscous melt.Step 2: SCF Injection – Under high pressure, a small amount of CO₂ or N₂ is injected into the barrel, saturating the melt with gas evenly.Step 3: Injection Molding – The gas-saturated melt is injected into the mold. Due to pressure drop, gas expands and forms microbubbles, resulting in a lighter, more uniform internal structure.Step 4: Cooling and Ejection – After cooling and solidification, the microcellular structure remains stable, producing lightweight, high-strength foamed plastic parts.  Environmental and Energy-Saving Benefits of MuCellMuCell (Microcellular Injection Molding) significantly reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions through material savings, reduced energy usage, improved productivity, lightweight design, and use of recycled materials—meeting corporate sustainability and carbon neutrality goals.Material Reduction → Lower Carbon Emissions from Plastic ManufacturingTraditional injection molding requires a large amount of virgin plastic, while MuCell can reduce plastic use by 10%–20% through microcellular foaming.Carbon emissions from plastic manufacturing:Virgin PP, ABS, and PC generate 2.5–6 kg of CO₂ per kg produced.MuCell saves 5–20% of material, equivalent to reducing 125–1,200 kg of CO₂ per ton of plastic.For example, a factory using 1,000 tons of plastic annually can save 200 tons by using MuCell—reducing 250–1,200 tons of CO₂, equivalent to planting 11,000–55,000 trees (each absorbing about 22 kg of CO₂ per year).Lower Injection Pressure and Machine Power Usage → Reduce Carbon Emissions During ManufacturingTraditional Injection Molding vs. MuCell:Traditional molding requires high-pressure mold filling. MuCell reduces filling pressure by 30%–50%, thereby reducing injection machine energy usage by 10%–40%.Injection machines account for about 60% of a factory’s total energy usage. CO₂ emissions from power generation average about 0.5 kg/kWh (depending on the energy source).Example: A plant using 10 million kWh/year and saving 20% energy with MuCell would reduce around 1,000 tons of CO₂—equivalent to the CO₂ absorbed by 91,000 trees.Shorter Cycle Times → Improved Productivity, Further Carbon ReductionMuCell shortens cooling and packing times by 15%–50%, resulting in:Higher output per unit time—more parts made with the same energy input, reducing emissions per part.Less idle or standby time for machines, minimizing energy waste.Assuming 20% increased machine productivity, the same output can be achieved with 20% less energy, thus reducing CO₂ emissions accordingly.Product Weight Reduction → Lower Transportation Carbon FootprintAutomotive Industry ApplicationMuCell can reduce the weight of automotive interior parts by 10%–30% (e.g., dashboards, seat frames, door panels).Every 100 kg reduction in vehicle weight reduces fuel vehicle CO₂ emissions by approximately 8–10 grams per kilometer; energy consumption in EVs is also lowered.If a vehicle is reduced by 5%–20% in weight, and applied to 100,000 vehicles, it can reduce 250–1,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually—equivalent to planting 22,500–90,000 trees.Electronics & Packaging MaterialsReducing the weight of plastic housings and packaging helps cut fuel consumption during transportation, lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Automotive Air Duct Panel Automotive Headlamp Housing AI Robot ShellCombining Recycled Plastics (PCR) → Further Reduce Carbon FootprintVirgin vs. Recycled Plastic Carbon Emissions ComparisonVirgin plastics (PP, ABS, PC) generate 2.5–6 kg of CO₂ per kg produced.Recycled plastics (PCR) generate 1–2 kg of CO₂ per kg, which is 50%–80% lower than virgin materials.If MuCell reduces plastic use by 30% and combines 50% PCR, then:Emissions from 1,000 tons of plastic can be cut from 5,000 tons CO₂ to 1,500 tons CO₂—a 70% reduction.This is equivalent to the CO₂ absorption of 318,000 trees (each absorbing 22 kg CO₂ per year).MuCell also enhances the use of recycled plastics by:Improving mechanical strength to compensate for rigidity loss in recycled material.Lowering injection temperature and pressure to reduce thermal degradation and improve processability.MuCell not only reduces the use of virgin plastics but also enhances the applicability of recycled materials—expanding the potential of sustainable plastics.Overall Carbon Reduction Benefits of MuCell TechnologyImpact CategoryCarbon Reduction EffectsReduce Plastic Usage10%–20% raw material savings, reduce plastic manufacturing emissionsLower Injection Energy10%–40% reduction in electricity use, cut factory emissionsBoost Production Efficiency15%–50% shorter cycle time, reduce operational emissionsLightweight Design10%–30% lighter products, lower transportation emissionsRecycled vs. Virgin Material50%–80% reduction in raw material production emissionsLower Scrap & Defect Rates10%–50% less plastic waste and disposal emissionsApplication Examples of MuCell Technology in Mobility & Bicycle IndustryMuCell technology is expected to see wide application in bicycles, e-scooters, motorcycles, and sporting goods, focusing on weight reduction, strength enhancement, and lower production energy consumption—supporting carbon reduction and sustainability. Application of MuCell in the bicycle industry. Goal: Reduce the weight of plastic support structures used with carbon fiber and aluminum parts, improving overall energy efficiency.MuCell Technology in Bicycle Components:Internal plastic reinforcement for bike frames → Estimated 5%–10% weight reductionPlastic housings for bike lights and e-assist systems → Estimated 25% plastic savingsFoamed plastic parts for saddles and handlebars → Estimated 15% lighter with added rigidityEnergy and Carbon Reduction Outcomes:Each bike is expected to reduce 300–500 g of CO₂Annual output of 500,000 bikes = 15,000–25,000 tons of CO₂ reduced, equivalent to planting 1.36 million trees MuCell + Recycled Plastics = Optimal Green Manufacturing SolutionCombining MuCell technology with recycled plastics (PCR) enables not only lightweighting, but also enhances environmental benefits—achieving lower carbon emissions, reduced raw material waste, and a more sustainable production process. This combination offers the best green solution across industries. Key benefits include:Reduced use of virgin plasticsLower carbon emissionsSupport for sustainable manufacturingCost savingsMuCell + Recycled Plastics enables lightweighting, raw material savings, significantly lower carbon emissions, reduced energy use, and plastic waste reduction.Each ton of plastic saved reduces 1,250–2,000 kg CO₂—equivalent to planting 113,000–181,000 treesThis green manufacturing approach helps companies achieve carbon neutrality goals and promotes the transition to sustainable developmentMuCell technology combined with recycled plastics is the optimal strategy for sustainability, carbon reduction, and competitive manufacturing! | FCS Deepens 40 Years of Multi-Component Technology, Launching the 5th Generation 2K Machines', hall = '12', stand = 'B80', logo_url = 'https://www.fcs.com.tw/images/default/loading.svg', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Hank Wu", "role": "General Sales Manager", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T00:54:20.820979', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

Established in 1959, we have evolved into a global leader in advanced materials, providing innovative solutions for industries such as footwear, automotive, ... | ECOVIVA® – Compostable Packaging Solutions | Dongsung Chemical announced on the 28th that, in collaboration with Cosmax, a leading global cosmetics original design manufacturer (ODM), it has successfully commercialized Korea’s first bio-based hot melt adhesive incorporating biodegradable bioplastic PHA.The two companies spent the past two years jointly developing the adhesive, which is now being used in cosmetic packaging. This milestone represents a significant step forward, combining sustainability with functionality.The adhesive, developed by Dongsung Chemical, contains 56% naturally derived ingredients—including PHA—and has received ‘bio-based’ certification from DIN CERTCO, a globally recognized German certification body. PHA is a polymer produced via microbial fermentation and is known to degrade by more than 90% within a year under natural conditions such as soil and seawater.Cosmax has adopted the adhesive in its production of shadow and cushion foundation packaging, successfully bonding aluminum containers to plastic outer shells. While the cosmetics industry has long sought alternatives to petroleum-based adhesives due to concerns over carbon dioxide emissions and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), achieving effective adhesion has remained a persistent challenge.Dongsung Chemical plans to expand its line of bio hot melt adhesives to sectors including cosmetics, household goods, electronics, and food packaging. By leveraging its proprietary resin formulation and synthesis technologies, the company aims to deliver tailored solutions for diverse client needs.“We are committed to building a sustainable packaging ecosystem in Korea, centered around the Bioplastic Complex—Korea’s only bioplastics innovation hub—which opened in Ulsan in 2024,” said Kim GeunMo, Director of Dongsung Chemical’s Bioplastics Division. “We also plan to release additional compostable adhesive products as we continue refining this technology.”Meanwhile, Cosmax plans to transition all hot melt adhesives used in its cosmetic containers to bio-based alternatives and expand their application from the domestic market to global markets. This effort is part of the company’s broader “2030 Plastics Initiative,” announced in 2023. | Dongsung Chemical, an eco-friendly materials science company, on April 30, announced the grand opening of its new polyurethane (PU) production facility in Karawang, Indonesia.The completion of the plant was marked by a ceremony attended by over 200 guests, including key leaders and dignitaries from Korea and Indonesia. Notable attendees included Dongsung Chemical Chairman Jeong-Ho Baek, CEOs Jin-Woo Baek and Man-Woo Lee, Indonesian Minister of Investment and Downstream Industry Rosan Perkasa Roeslani, and Acting Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Indonesia Su-Deok Park.Construction of the Karawang facility began in September 2023. Trial production was completed earlier this year, with full-scale operations commencing in February 2025.Spanning 81,000 square meters, the new plant boasts an annual production capacity of 67,000 tons of prepolymers, polyester polyols, and polyurethane resins, tripling the output of Dongsung Chemical’s existing PU plants in Korea, Vietnam, and China. It is also expected to generate approximately 150 million USD in annual revenue.The plant is also equipped with storage capacity for up to 1,000 tons of essential PU raw materials, ensuring supply chain stability and uninterrupted production, even in the face of global disruptions. Advanced automation systems further improve operational efficiency and product quality.Positioned in one of Indonesia’s key industrial zones, the plant will serve as a strategic base for Dongsung Chemical’s global expansion, particularly across Southeast Asia, the Americas, and Europe. Beyond its existing footprint in footwear, synthetic leather, automotive, and electronics, the company plans to enter the furniture materials market.During the business overview presentation, CEO Man-Woo Lee outlined the company’s ambitious global strategy: “By capitalizing on Indonesia’s logistical advantages—its proximity to major ports and pivotal position in the automotive supply chain—we plan to deliver high-quality products to our customers with speed and efficiency. This new facility will serve as a key launching pad for Dongsung Chemical’s global expansion.”Chairman Jeong-Ho Baek added, “This plant will become the leading PU production base in Southeast Asia and a vital hub in our global network. We remain committed to creating exceptional value through innovation and sustainable practices.”Indonesian Minister Rosan Perkasa Roeslani commented, “I would like to emphasize our Ministry’s commitment to continue facilitating and supporting quality investments in Indonesia, including through streamlined licensing, strengthened coordination, and improved investment climate.”', hall = '6', stand = 'C52', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Minsoo Kim", "role": "Bio Packaging Solution", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T00:37:30.515911', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

Nuova Idropress S.p.A.
NUOVA IDROPRESS S.p.A., founded in 1963, designs, manufactures and installs complete systems and machines for the production, processing and recovery of EPS since 50 years.
It is therefore one of the oldest companies, which is dealing with machines for industrial generation of EPS boards since the invention of EPS in the 50th and the commercial introduction of insulation boards in the 60th.

The Company, at the moment has two plants with a total surface area of 15.000 m2 where approximately 110 people are employed as technicians and workers. In 1971 it made the first of more than 600 Vertical Block Moulding machines produced to date and all of which are still operating throughout the world.
The will to grow and the constant technical research brought us to expand our Department of Development Research and Customer Service.

This is a feather in our cap as we rely on more than 30 experienced engineers that design on last generation software in 3D (mechanical part), realize the software for PLC and Machine Supervision (on PC) that are at the base of the functioning of our Machinery and they deal with the start-up of the Plants, as well as the post-sales service (via internet) ensuring a support to the customers in fundamental languages.
From the moment that we think that selling a plant is only the starting point of a profitable collaboration with a Customer, it follows that a structure of adequate technical support results for us an indispensable point to apply to the base of growth of our Company that proceeds at the same pace with the full satisfaction of our Customers.

Nowadays the machines of Nuova Idropress are working in 50 countries worldwide, in 5 continents and NUOVA IDROPRESS S.p.A. is the market leader and the main supplier of many of the main industrial groups of EPS producers for insulation materials.

THE ALBRECHT BÄUMER COMPANY
Albrecht Bäumer GmbH & Co. KG has been a leading manufacturer of machinery and equipment for the foam industry for almost 70 years. The company''s focus is on special machines for cutting, processing and transporting polyurethane foams and similar materials. In this field, we have developed as a medium-sized company from a pioneer to a global market leader.

We have our own sales and service subsidiaries in the USA, Japan and China. One of Bäumer''s success factors is its training activities; approx. 10% of the workforce are trainees. Sales averaged about 45 million euros in recent years, 85% of which was contributed by foreign business. Jan Henrik Leisse and Nina Patisson are the fourth generation to run the family business.

founded in 1946 and since then constantly growing innovatively with the industry, today about 300 employees worldwide, mainly in Germany, are engaged in the development, design and manufacture of a wide range of products. Customized solutions up to turnkey plants are developed. In addition to standardized solutions, customer-specific special requests are also implemented, as you can see from our name "Spezialmaschinenfabrik". We therefore see it as our task to develop and manufacture machines and plants together with our customers, which guarantee the highest possible quality at reasonable prices and high productivity.

In order to significantly influence and actively shape the future development in this product area, a company is required that acts and innovatively responds to the needs of the market. Given the variety of products and the catalog of requirements, this is a comprehensive task and a positive challenge that we are happy to take on.

Uway builds extrusion systems using simple designs and focusing only on the top component suppliers in order to provide our customers with dependable machinery that produces consistent, high quality and high volume output. Uway specializes in customized systems from the lab scal up to 7 tons per hour.

Having installations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa, Uway has a global view of our customers and therefore we use components that are of international standards. This means when maintenance does occur your staff will not have to spend time retrofitting parts. Downtime during maintenance will be reduced, maintenance expenses will be lower, and more time can be spent producing sellable product.

In 2014 Uway manufactured 64 sheet lines and approximately 130 twin-screw extruders. Much of Uway Extrusion’s success can be attributed to sole owner Dustin Kremer’s background. “Being third generation and having experience operating, maintaining and building the [extruders],” Kremer said, “I have a unique perspective on how to create the machinery to meet the customers’ needs. I focus on keeping the machinery simple and reliable, while making the extruders generic enough that parts can be locally sourced to prevent production delays.”
