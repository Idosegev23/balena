BioCote Ltd
BioCote® – Antimicrobial solutions you can trust

Proud members of the British Plastics Federation, BioCote® is a worldwide market-leading antimicrobial additives supplier with an established history of over 30 years. Trusted by leading brands and manufacturers of plastic products, BioCote® takes pride in their technology being recognised for its quality, traceability, and credibility all around the world.

BioCote®’s extensive portfolio of antimicrobial additives includes silver, zinc, and organic compounds, as well as combinations such as silver/zinc blends. Working without an off switch, the technology has demonstrated an 86% reduction in microbes in only 15 minutes and a 99.9% reduction in 24 hours.

The antimicrobial additives can be easily and cost-effectively integrated into a wide variety of polymer materials, formulations, and polymer blends during manufacturing without affecting the colour or mechanical properties of the material. Offering an extensive variety of antimicrobial additives for engineering plastics and commodity polymers in concentrated powder or masterbatch form, the company has the capability to create bespoke polymer-specific masterbatches to meet any moulding or extrusion process.

Designed to have antimicrobial efficacy at low dosage rates, BioCote®’s powder and masterbatch additives do not affect the overall structure of a polymer. This means, if a polymer is recyclable, the addition of BioCote® will not influence its recyclability. ⁠What’s even better, once incorporated into a product, BioCote®’s additives work continuously to protect against odour formation, staining and material degradation caused by microbes. This ultimately helps to prevent early product failure and can reduce the output of resources in manufacturing due to there being fewer, but better quality, products being made – a shift from quantity to quality that is key to progressing towards sustainable production.

At BioCote®, we are committed to making a real difference to any business by working with our customers to deliver distinctive, high-value products to market. Partnering with BioCote® brings additional benefits, such as a comprehensive support package from our multi-disciplined team of antimicrobial specialists, a 24/7 Partner Portal, or brand affiliation with other well-known BioCote® partners.

BioCote® is more than just an antimicrobial additive supplier. We believe in an open, consultative approach to antimicrobial product integration, continuously working in partnership with our customers from product development to market entry and beyond.

Electrically Conductive Polymers as Bipolar ', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Researchers present sustainable materials for industry | Whether it''s films made from apple pomace, environmentally friendly flame retardants or electrically conductive polymers: Fraunhofer UMSICHT is presenting its wide-ranging expertise in the fields of plastics and the circular economy at this year''s K trade fair in Düsseldorf. The researchers can be found from October 8 to 15 at the joint stand of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in Hall 7, Level 0, Stand C05.The exhibit “A Matter of Fruit” demonstrates how pomace from industrial fruit processing can be used to make biodegradable films – an alternative to synthetic materials. Depending on their thickness, the films can be classified visually and characteristically as paper, plastic, or leather and can be used in interior design as well as a substitute for leather. A special aspect of the pomace-based material is its use as a design object: Differently processed apple pomace becomes opaque to translucent, printed, shaped, or welded into a wide variety of products. Verena Brom, designer and initiator of "A Matter of Fruit", brought her start-up project for developing films made from apple pomace as well as crucial expertise into the collaboration funded by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Combined with Fraunhofer UMSICHT''s expertise in continuous plastics processing, the films made from apple pomace could be produced on industrial plants. Agricultural films with nutrients for optimized vegetable cultivation Agricultural films are extremely useful in agriculture. They improve the growth of plants, protect the soil from drying out and minimize weed growth. In the "Humic mulch" project, a research team from Fraunhofer UMSICHT has now developed a biodegradable mulch film with humic substances that further optimizes vegetable cultivation. The nutrients contained in the mulch film are absorbed into the soil together with the film at the end of the growing season.Bio-based flame retardant as an alternative to halogenated compounds The causes of building, industrial or vehicle fires often lie in highly flammable home textiles or inadequately protected plastic components. This is where high-performance flame retardants (FRs) based on halogenated compounds are used. Despite their high effectiveness, FRs are increasingly being withdrawn from the market due to their toxicologically and ecologically problematic properties. Bio-based and more environmentally friendly alternatives are therefore highly relevant. In the project "Bio-Phy-FR" project, the researchers developed a bio-based flame retardant based on phytic acid for products in the textile and plastics processing industry.Networking the textile industry for a circular textile industry 2 to 10 percent of the EU''s environmental impact is attributable to clothing consumption. A transformation towards a circular textile industry requires cooperation between industry, science and society. This is where the "KlarTEXt" project comes in, developing measures for a socially and ecologically sustainable textile industry and bringing all stakeholders together. The "Digital Textile Stakeholder Map" at the K trade fair shows how this networking can be activated.Thermally and electrically conductive polymers for hydrogen applications and heating components Another focus of the trade fair presentation is on thermally and electrically conductive polymers: UMSICHT researchers can produce ultra-thin composite biopolar sheets cost-effectively using a patented, continuous powder-to-roll process. These thermoplastic-based films can form the basis of innovative stack designs for electrolysers and fuel cells, for example: With their help, stacks can be welded and built without seals. This means that sealing elements in the stack are replaced by weld seams, which in particular reduces vulnerable sealing surfaces in the stack and thus reduces production waste. Furthermore, both the number of components in the stack and the number of stacking processes and thus the assembly effort can be reduced in equal measure. In addition to the bipolar plates themselves, a seal-free PEM electrolysis stack and seal-free PEM fuel cells will also be on display at the K trade fair.The UMSICHT researchers will also be presenting heatable heat-shrinkable tubing at the K trade fair - an innovative alternative to the heating tapes and heating cords currently available on the market. They open up new possibilities, particularly in pipe trace heating for heat retention or frost protection in the process and food industries.Does that sound interesting? Then make an appointment directly with our colleagues at the K trade fair. | Exhibitors & Products | Digital Services Act (DSA)', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Joachim Danzig", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T00:59:23.843798', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

NISSEI ASB GmbH
Under the corporate principles "Generate affluence for people and society" and "Maintain company growth by providing high level technology and service," we have been developing our business with the aim of popularizing safe and convenient plastic containers for nearly 45 years. We are proud that we have been delivering injection stretch blow molding machines and molds to clients in more than 130 countries, contributing to the wellbeing of people all over the world.

Our company history is also the history of PET bottles. ASB started its business in 1978, one year after the first introduction of PET bottles in Japan (1977). Since then, the lightweight property, safety, and recyclability of plastic materials, especially PET, have been widely recognized around the world, leading to the widespread use of plastics. Plastic containers are used to contain a great variety of products, from refreshing beverages to liquors, seasoning agent, detergents, and pharmaceutical agents. We expect that the use of plastic containers will become increasingly popular in the future in a diverse range of fields.

In the midst of the complicated social situation, we may face many difficulties in the days ahead. But we are committed to delivering even more convenience to our customers around the world, constantly reminding ourselves that we should never be easily satisfied with the status quo. We would like to ask for your continued support and encouragement in the years to come.
