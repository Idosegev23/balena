Bernhard Ide GmbH & Co. KG Werkzeug- und Maschinenbau für die Kunststoffverarbeitung
When Bernhard Ide moved into his first factory workshops in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen in 1957 he laid the foundations for a successful industrial concern. Over more than 50 years IDE has developed from a small family undertaking into an accomplished and multi-functional medium-sized manufacturing enterprise serving the plastics industry. Modular designed machine and tooling systems which are easily adaptable to customer specifications have made IDE an internationally renowned leader in the extrusion sector today.

Our systems and services cover the entire extrusion process. We produce all of the machines and tooling systems that are necessary to process thermoplastics. We are continually developing our products in collaboration with customers and external partners and the results of that co-operation serve as the basis for designing and manufacturing new and better systems which save work and increase productivity. Our machinery and tooling systems are manufactured with technological know-how and perfected craftsmanship. They not only ensure reliable production, but are adaptable to your growing demands and can be easily retrofitted.

IDE machine and tooling systems have an excellent reputation world-wide. The longevity and dependability of our machines is legendary and our wide range of equipment allows tailored solutions for every branch of industry. But the best about our machines are the practically endless combinations and extensions possible. IDE machine modules make adaptation to new production conditions quick and easy. That is why our machines are utilised in precision fields such as the automotive, medical and the electrical industries.

In extrusion the profile is only as good as the tooling system. Only the very latest production techniques in tooling manufacture are practised at IDE. Our highly-qualified and experienced toolmakers carry out precision work on every order. Our special know-how is where plastic comes into contact with metal. This knowledge enables us to design and manufacture perfect tooling systems for every extrusion project.

Quick and uncomplicated help is a matter of fact. Many of our customers have enjoyed decades of complete IDE support. We accompany our customers with a variety of comprehensive services far beyond the purchase of machinery and tooling.

IDE is and remains committed to extrusion.

Colorfix Masterbatches, based in Paraná, will be present in Pavilion 8B – Stand H30, as a co-exhibitor in partnership with ApexBrasil and Think Plastic Brazil, presenting two innovations: the Marble Line and Revora CO₂RE Carbon Reduced, which represents the future of the sector.The Marble Line combines sophisticated aesthetics and high performance, with 85 color options and a strikingly realistic marbled effect, serving segments such as household goods, luxury packaging, and automotive. Revora CO₂RE is a disruptive technology that incorporates CO₂ into the production of compounds, reducing the carbon footprint and boosting the circular economy.“We will take this to the global showcase of the plastics industry because these solutions reflect the distinctive design, technological advancement, and environmental commitment that are the pillars of our company,” says Colorfix CEO Francielo Fardo. For him, “more than just exhibiting products, participation in Feira K 2025 will be strategic for expanding the brand''s international presence, strengthening partnerships, and anticipating trends that will shape the industry in the coming years,” he points out. Colorfix has participated in previous editions of Feira K, but as a visitor, an opportunity that brought many ideas that were used in the company''s daily activities. "This will be the first time we will be participating as exhibitors. We want to show that it is possible to combine technical performance, beauty, and environmental responsibility, delivering solutions to the market that make a difference for the future," explains Fardo, who will be alongside eight other company representatives participating in the fair. From Brazil to the world With an annual production of nearly 3,000 tons of specialized masterbatches, Colorfix currently has a portfolio of around 90,000 colors and additives, which promote the improvement of both products and customer processes. Some of these products, including the Marble line and the Revora brand, are already part of the collection of the prestigious Material Connexion Innovation Library, located in New York (USA), which has more than 10,000 material profiles, carefully selected to bring the most innovative trends and technologies in the world.In recent decades, the company has been working on sustainable solutions that meet the needs of society and the market. Although plastic is a recyclable material, negligence in its disposal and the difficulty in differentiating between types of resin leads many people to consider it harmful to nature.The company recently launched Colorfix Revora CO₂RE, a product born from the vision of creating a positive impact on the planet and, through this, influencing companies and brands to adopt products that promote circularity and sustainability. The Colorfix Revora CO₂RE Carbon Reduced line is the embodiment of this vision, combining materials from various sources, including renewable polymers and recycled materials.Following the circular concept, the entire line is tracked in relation to its carbon footprint, from the extraction of raw materials, transportation, and production, to the company''s exit gate. This entire process uses a methodology based on ISO 14067, aligned with ESG certifications – ESG, which involves social, environmental, and governance practices, and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), which provides proof of compliance with environmental, social, and traceability criteria, as defined by the European Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).“We want major global brands to learn about this important innovation, which is one of the solutions for a more environmentally responsible world, and with it, the industry will have an important ally in this constant quest. And anyone attending the K Fair will have the opportunity to learn more about Revora CO₂RE,” emphasizes the CEO. Revora CO₂RE has 18 different compounds aimed at a wide range of segments, such as packaging, furniture, general parts, single-use products, decks, automobiles, agribusiness, and packaging that does not come into contact with food. Development of an innovative and sustainable solution, with reduced and negative carbon footprints that can be applied to various plastic products;
