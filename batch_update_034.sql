ERE Kunststoff RAM-Extrusion GmbH & Co. KG Kelberg
Founded in 1983 by Herbert Mayer, the company initially focused on the production of semi-finished products made of UHMW-PE using the RAM extrusion process. At the same time, the company also processed unmixed plastic production rejects in injection molding and extrusion quality.

After RAM extrusion was discontinued and due to the company''s own need for tools and the wear of screws and barrels, the production of screws, barrels and machine components as well as the compounding of plastics were continuously expanded into efficient, customer- and future-oriented divisions.

In addition to the main factory and ... | MuCell Microcellular Foaming Technology: The Optimal Solution for Lightweighting and Sustainable Manufacturing | MuCell technology has been widely applied in industries such as automotive, electronics, medical, sporting goods, and green manufacturing. Under the growing trends of lightweighting and carbon reduction, it has become a major breakthrough in sustainable and efficient manufacturing. Particularly in the transportation and bicycle industries, MuCell offers lightweighting solutions that reduce plastic usage while enhancing product strength and durability—further lowering carbon footprints.Overview of MuCell Technology MuCell (Microcellular Injection Molding) technology  was developed in the 1980s by Professor Nam P. Suh and his research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and commercialized in the 1990s. The core of MuCell technology lies in using Supercritical Fluid (SCF) techniques to inject carbon dioxide (CO₂) or nitrogen (N₂) into molten plastic to form a uniform microcellular structure. This process reduces material consumption, lowers product weight, and improves both product performance and processing efficiency.Development History of MuCell Technology1980s – Concept Formation and Initial ResearchThe research team at MIT developed a Supercritical Fluid (SCF) process that injected CO₂ or N₂ as physical blowing agents into molten polymers, forming a uniform microcellular structure.The initial aim was to reduce material usage while enhancing mechanical properties such as dimensional stability and warpage control.1990s – Industrial Applications and Patent DevelopmentMIT''s research outcomes led to the commercialization of MuCell technology, and the establishment of Trexel, Inc., which specialized in promoting the technology and developing dedicated equipment.Trexel began applying MuCell technology to sectors such as automotive, electronics, and medical devices, and obtained numerous patents covering gas control systems, mold design, and injection molding process optimization.Post-2000s – Global Expansion and Technology OptimizationAs the technology matured, MuCell gained acceptance in European and Asian markets. Driven by demands for automotive lightweighting (to reduce fuel consumption) and sustainable energy (to reduce plastic usage), many companies adopted this solution.To meet various application needs, MuCell technology further evolved to include:High-precision foaming control (for 3C products and precision manufacturing)Hybrid foaming techniques (to improve stiffness and mechanical strength)Recent Years – Smart Manufacturing and SustainabilityMuCell technology has been integrated into smart manufacturing (e.g., Industry 4.0), enhancing process stability through data monitoring and automation.The development of MuCell is no longer limited to reducing plastic use and maintaining part rigidity. New applications are emerging, such as ultra-lightweight, high-rebound shoe midsoles, noise-reducing, insulating, cold-retaining industrial products, and biomimetic medical applications.Many companies are combining MuCell technology with recyclable plastics to further improve sustainability—for example, by using bio-based or recycled materials to reduce carbon footprints. Figure: MuCell Application in Footwear Midsoles MuCell Molding ProcessCompared with traditional injection molding, MuCell adds an extra step where a supercritical fluid is injected. The detailed steps are as follows:Step 1: Plastic Melting – Thermoplastics (such as PP, ABS, PC) are melted inside the injection machine, forming a hot viscous melt.Step 2: SCF Injection – Under high pressure, a small amount of CO₂ or N₂ is injected into the barrel, saturating the melt with gas evenly.Step 3: Injection Molding – The gas-saturated melt is injected into the mold. Due to pressure drop, gas expands and forms microbubbles, resulting in a lighter, more uniform internal structure.Step 4: Cooling and Ejection – After cooling and solidification, the microcellular structure remains stable, producing lightweight, high-strength foamed plastic parts.  Environmental and Energy-Saving Benefits of MuCellMuCell (Microcellular Injection Molding) significantly reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions through material savings, reduced energy usage, improved productivity, lightweight design, and use of recycled materials—meeting corporate sustainability and carbon neutrality goals.Material Reduction → Lower Carbon Emissions from Plastic ManufacturingTraditional injection molding requires a large amount of virgin plastic, while MuCell can reduce plastic use by 10%–20% through microcellular foaming.Carbon emissions from plastic manufacturing:Virgin PP, ABS, and PC generate 2.5–6 kg of CO₂ per kg produced.MuCell saves 5–20% of material, equivalent to reducing 125–1,200 kg of CO₂ per ton of plastic.For example, a factory using 1,000 tons of plastic annually can save 200 tons by using MuCell—reducing 250–1,200 tons of CO₂, equivalent to planting 11,000–55,000 trees (each absorbing about 22 kg of CO₂ per year).Lower Injection Pressure and Machine Power Usage → Reduce Carbon Emissions During ManufacturingTraditional Injection Molding vs. MuCell:Traditional molding requires high-pressure mold filling. MuCell reduces filling pressure by 30%–50%, thereby reducing injection machine energy usage by 10%–40%.Injection machines account for about 60% of a factory’s total energy usage. CO₂ emissions from power generation average about 0.5 kg/kWh (depending on the energy source).Example: A plant using 10 million kWh/year and saving 20% energy with MuCell would reduce around 1,000 tons of CO₂—equivalent to the CO₂ absorbed by 91,000 trees.Shorter Cycle Times → Improved Productivity, Further Carbon ReductionMuCell shortens cooling and packing times by 15%–50%, resulting in:Higher output per unit time—more parts made with the same energy input, reducing emissions per part.Less idle or standby time for machines, minimizing energy waste.Assuming 20% increased machine productivity, the same output can be achieved with 20% less energy, thus reducing CO₂ emissions accordingly.Product Weight Reduction → Lower Transportation Carbon FootprintAutomotive Industry ApplicationMuCell can reduce the weight of automotive interior parts by 10%–30% (e.g., dashboards, seat frames, door panels).Every 100 kg reduction in vehicle weight reduces fuel vehicle CO₂ emissions by approximately 8–10 grams per kilometer;

European Bioplastics e.V.
Well established in this industry, bioplastics MAGAZINE, is more than ever the global number one trade magazine dedicated exclusively to bioplastics, i.e. plastics from renewable resources and/or biodegradable plastics. And over the last years bioplastics MAGAZINE (including the web-based daily news and the smartphone/tablet app) has indeed become the unique information platform for bioplastics worldwide. bioplastics MAGAZINE is complemented by basic books and high class conferences, published and organized by Polymedia
Publisher GmbH.

bioplastics MAGAZINE is read by decision-makers in all parts of this
business. For instance raw material suppliers and compounders,
machine and mold makers, converters, brand owners, the complete distribution chain (wholesale and retail) as well as lobbyists, scientists and politicians, bioplastics MAGAZINE is an independent and neutral source of information.

With an average print run of 5000 (depending on large events such as
as exhibitions or conferences) the estimated number of readers is
of course much higher, as many copies of bioplastics MAGAZINE are
circulated or passed on to other interested readers.

Since its start in early 2006 bioplastics MAGAZINE has experienced a constant, and very positive, feedback from its readers.

The successful and high class conferences organized by
bioplastics MAGAZINE include the PLA World Congress (the sixth
will be in May 2020), the PHA platform World Congress as well as
the Bioplastics Business Breakfasts (during K-fair), the bio!PAC
conference (biobased materials for the packaging industry in May
2015, 2017 and 2019), bio!CAR (biobased materials for automotive
applications in Sept 2015, 2017 and 2019) and the new bio!TOY
(biobased materials for toy applications in spring 2019). Please
contact us for sponsoring, exhibiting or speaking opportunities.
Advertising in bioplastics MAGAZINE (print or digital in newletters,
app, or on the website) is easy and affordable, and it exactly
meets the target group, whether it is via a web-banner*, an entry
in the Suppliers Guide (print and online) or printed adverts in the
magazine. Also the cover-page is available for special cover-ads..
On the other hand, bioplastics MAGAZINE is always interested in editorial contributions.

Advertising and editorial contributions - bioplastics MAGAZINE is the essential platform for your communication.
