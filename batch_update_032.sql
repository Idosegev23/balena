Bioplastics, cellulose', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | GRAFE expands its proven service for OEMs and design partners outside the automotive industryIn today''s digital age, are physical reference samples still necessary?This question arises time and again in an era of digital color models, simulations, and 3D renderings. But in the reality of long development processes and complex value chains, the answer is clear: Yes, absolutely. Physical master samples remain indispensable! On the one hand, they serve as a feasibility analysis for implementing the OEM''s color requirements in polymer, and on the other hand, they provide a defined color concept and reference for the color and gloss level of various plastic parts at the supplier. They enable precise and consistent evaluation of components across all stages of the production chain, regardless of screen displays, lighting conditions, or subjective impressions.OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and ODMs (original design manufacturers) in particular, who value high color precision, use these haptic reference samples, which are made available to the parts manufacturer. To adjust the colors of different plastic components and match them in color matching – primarily in the mobility sector, such as automotive engineering, aviation, rail, and shipbuilding. But there are also OEM structures in medical technology and in the electrical and household appliance sectors that need to ensure design consistency. This is not just a matter for the suppliers or parts manufacturers themselves, but also for the companies that have a decisive influence on color design and material selection, are responsible for these decisions, and guarantee them across all instances.GRAFE – an experienced partner for master sample sheets for over 20 yearsThe GRAFE Group, based in Blankenhain, has been an established partner for OEMs and their design departments for two decades. The masterbatch and compound specialist supports customers from the initial color idea to the finished reference sample. What began as a service primarily for the automotive sector is now a comprehensive range of individual services that, in addition to the actual production of master samples, covers expert advice on all aspects of color development – whether it''s choosing the degree of gloss, the grain, or selecting suitable carrier materials and packaging."Our master samples are not only used in the automotive sector. We are increasingly receiving inquiries from other industries that depend on maximum color accuracy and reproducibility,“ explains Lars Schulze, Head of Color Development and Material Sciences, adding: ”GRAFE typically produces between 300 and 600 master sample plates per color development – with high consistency, the tightest tolerances, and long-term color stability. This is real added value for brands with long-term product and manufacturing cycles."Comprehensive master sample service – smooth and preciseGRAFE''s master sample service is based on a structured, tried-and-tested process that requires close cooperation with OEMs and ODMs, thereby enabling successful color development.The first step is careful project planning so that the desired grain and surface structure can be selected in the next step, which serves as the basis for tool design. Based on digital color values or physical color templates, such as paint samples, fabric or leather samples, and even metal elements, GRAFE''s colorists then develop a precise color formula for the substrate material used. The desired color tone is then provided to the OEM as a sample plate for further iteration loops in order to fine-tune the color until approval is granted. The final production of the master sample plates takes place under the highest quality standards.Depending on customer requirements, visual and metrological checks are carried out on a random basis or for each individual sample. Colorimetric measurement and documentation complete the quality assurance process. The labeled and packaged master sample plates are then sent to the OEM/ODM or – as GRAFE services – directly to Tier 1 or Tier 2 suppliers, as desired. In addition to the main service of solid-colored master sample plates, special solutions such as paintable samples with a structured surface are also available.Indispensable reference – with added value from a single sourceDespite times of accelerated product development with high design demands, haptic samples are not losing their importance as a binding reference. They enable reliable assessment under real conditions and accompany projects over many years. GRAFE not only supplies the reference sample, but can also offer the right material for subsequent series production – a perfect symbiosis. The masterbatch and compound specialist GRAFE stands for competence, precision, and passion from the initial idea to the perfect reference. | Color variety for biodegradable plastics – sustainable, certified and design-orientedBiodegradable plastics play a key role in sustainable product development – especially where mechanical recycling is technically difficult or economically unfeasible. With its BIOCOLEN ® product range, GRAFE, based in Blankenhain, offers a tailor-made solution for precisely these areas of application: individually colored, biodegradable plastics that are not only compostable but also meet high aesthetic and functional requirements.Unlike traditional polymer types, which are increasingly required by law to be recycled, the masterbatches and compounds in the BIOCOLEN® range are inherently designed to be degradable, offering a forward-looking option for products with a limited service life. Examples range from packaging and disposable products to hygiene articles. BIOCOLEN® combines ecological responsibility with technical feasibility and design freedom.Certified sustainability – with expert supportA key unique selling point of GRAFE is the comprehensive support it offers its customers – not only in material selection and coloring, but also in the complex certification process. The company provides targeted support for the development of compostable plastic products right through to the award of renowned quality seals for end products, including ‘OK compost HOME’, ‘OK compost INDUSTRIAL’ and ‘OK biodegradable’ from TÜV Austria. These internationally recognised labels stand for proven environmentally friendly disposal – whether in domestic compost or under industrial conditions. Although GRAFE does not carry out the actual certification itself, it has been working closely with the responsible testing agency for many years. This proven partnership and direct exchange enable a particularly efficient and smooth process.Right from the development phase, GRAFE ensures that all ingredients used in the manufacture of its BIOCOLEN® masterbatches and compounds meet the requirements of the respective certification, both in terms of selection and dosage. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that the colorants do not adversely affect the testing of the end product. Particular emphasis is placed on selecting suitable pigments, especially with regard to compliance with the strict heavy metal limits specified in DIN EN 13432. Before delivery, comprehensive tests are carried out in the company''s own analytical laboratory in order to identify potential problems at an early stage and avoid unnecessary iteration steps – which also saves time and money.GRAFE offers PHBV and PLA, among other things, as carrier materials. Alternatively, customers can provide their own polymers to test their suitability as carriers and thus ensure the highest possible material purity in the end product.Functionality meets design – even with biodegradable materialsContrary to the widespread misconception that biodegradable plastics are visually or technically limited, GRAFE proves the opposite with BIOCOLEN®. The company''s color experts apply a wide range of colors, including soft pastel shades and signal colors, to biodegradable substrates. Thanks to innovative formulations, optical effects can also be achieved without compromising compostability. This design freedom opens up new possibilities for differentiated brand identities in the sustainability segment.Additives for application-specific requirementsIn addition to color design, GRAFE also offers a targeted selection of additives for BIOCOLEN ® products, always taking into account biodegradability and the desired certification. This significantly expands the range of applications and makes BIOCOLEN ® a versatile masterbatch solution for a wide variety of industries.Bio-based but not biodegradable: the TEKOLEN range as a logical additionIn addition to classic petrochemical polymers, the GRAFE TEKOLEN ® product range also includes bio-based plastics that are not biodegradable. This alternative can be used for durable products that are deliberately not compostable but are made from sustainably produced polymers. Here too, GRAFE naturally offers comprehensive options for coloring and functional additives – tailored to the respective target application and process control.Conclusion: Sustainable plastic solutions with a systemWith BIOCOLEN ® and TEKOLEN ® , GRAFE addresses the key challenges of sustainable plastics processing. Thanks to its in-depth expertise, broad understanding of materials and strong commitment to service, the company supports its customers from the initial idea to the market-ready solution – always with the aim of combining innovation, environmental protection and design at the highest level. | GRAFE revises standard black portfolio for 3D printing 3D printing has undergone rapid development in recent years and now characterises numerous industries. To this end, the Thuringian company GRAFE, based in Blankenhain, is enriching the market with customer-specific colourings and expanding its standard range alongside the RAL K7 fan and customer-specific colour settings in all common thermoplastics in this area. Three new standard black variants have been added, which are among the most important materials in 3D printing and are suitable for numerous applications. "Our aim is to meet customer requirements even faster and to cover a wide range of customer requirements with the predefined range," says Lars Schulze, Head of Colour Development and Material Sciences. "Our years of project work have shown that we not only need high-performance materials and excellent colour settings, but also fast and cost-efficient solutions," the specialist continues.The Schwarz portfolio now includes three masterbatches with the carrier materials PETG and PLA. In addition to the classic PLA variant, an additional option is offered that meets the strict requirements with FDA approval for food contact. Established processes and a universal formulation, which does not require any customisation, enable cost-efficient production and rapid provision of standard batches. This allows a particularly competitive and attractive offer to be realised in the GRAFE range. "In contrast to classic UN substrates, we also want to give our customers who demand the highest quality the option of selecting a substrate that matches the print material. This eliminates compromises in terms of layer adhesion, warping or flow properties. We also offer our customers this service for our standard colour range," says Schulze PETG - Robust and versatile Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) combines stability with flexibility and is extremely resistant to mechanical stress and moisture. The material is also characterised by high impact strength, temperature and weather resistance and low shrinkage. These properties make PETG ideal for the production of robust components, prototypes and end products. It is also ideal for technical applications, housings and functional components that require high durability. PETG is favoured by engineers, designers and private users due to its excellent printability and strong layer adhesion and is also suitable for a wide range of industrial applications.  PLA - Sustainable and biodegradable Polylactide (PLA) is a bio-based plastic material made from renewable raw materials such as corn starch or sugar cane. It is characterised by low moisture absorption and simplified storage. PLA also has good mechanical properties, such as high surface hardness, rigidity and high tensile strength. Due to its environmental friendliness and ease of processing for industrial and private applications, PLA is a versatile material that is ideal for modelling, product design and decorative items. "PLA and PETG are the most popular materials in 3D printing and are valued both in industry and by hobby users," explains Schulze. Further colour variants and optimised formulations will follow this year. "Our customers benefit from high-quality colour masterbatches in accordance with international standards and can even obtain selected standard items from stock at short notice," says Schulze. | Thanks to special processes and sample boxes, customers save development time with GRAFE Using a special process, the GRAFE GROUP, Blankenhain, is able to test and simulate color ideas for multilayer applications as early as the development phase. "In this way, we achieve results faster for material designs in this area and can optimize the development time for individually tailored products for the benefit of our customers," explains Lars Schulze, Head of Color Development and Material Sciences.Multilayer applications are widely used in the packaging and pharmaceutical industries to protect products from environmental influences and extend their shelf life. In the furniture industry or for high-quality consumer goods, laminates are a cost-effective alternative that achieves a high-quality surface appearance - with minimal use of effect pigments."The carrier material in the base color, in combination with the applied effect carrier, saves through-dyed plastic," explains Schulze. A decorative film, which carries expensive effect pigments for the look, is combined with the inexpensive solid-colored base material, which ensures the stability of the product," adds the expert. "This combination consisting of a base layer and a translucent effect layer enables unique color effects that cannot be achieved with monochrome coloring, or only at very high cost."The challenge in developing the color design lies in the dosage of pigments in the top layer in combination with the appearance of the substrate material. "With our technology, corresponding color ideas can be tested cost-effectively and simulated in-house, which saves the customer time, material and machine set-up costs and therefore also costs during product development," reports Schulze.With specially developed sample profiles, GRAFE offers its customers a service that allows them to get an impressive picture in advance. "With the help of four basic colors, from white to gray to black gradations, we have applied different effect variants. Due to the multi-layer structure, they illustrate the depth effect achieved by layering," says the color developer, pointing out that the top layer can also be equipped with the desired properties, additives or aggregates. Every individual color development is included in our development service.""A sample box with a collection of sample PETG tiles is available for customer consultation. The plates, which are the size of a credit card, are based on the GRAFE 2024/25 color trends. In view of the wide range of possible applications in the film and sheet industry, other plastics are also conceivable," Schulze adds. The company is also looking forward to inquiries and close cooperation with industry partners from a wide range of sectors for a variety of other decorative effects.', hall = '6', stand = 'A63', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Sebastian Grafe", "role": "Head Of Sales", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Steffen Schubert", "role": "Head Of Sales D-A-CH", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Florian Ludwig", "role": "Head Of Sales Export", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Lars Schulze", "role": "Head of Color Development and Material Sciences", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Dr. Carlos Juan Caro", "role": "Compounds & Rotomoulding Unit (HD Kunststoffe GmbH)", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Anja Zimmermann", "role": "Public Relations (PR)", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Manfred Fischer", "role": "Head Of Marketing", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T01:05:33.344877', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'
