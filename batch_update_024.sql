Supreme Petrochem Ltd.
Supreme Petrochem Ltd. is promoted jointly by The Supreme Industries Ltd., India’s largest plastics processor, and the well diversified R. Raheja Investments Pvt Ltd. 
The Supreme Industries Limited, founded in 1942 has been relevant with the changing times and continues to be a household name solely because of the core values that they uphold.
Raheja Group has multifarious business interests covering cement, ceramic tiles, automotive batteries, cable TV, retail superstores, construction, etc.

Supreme Petrochem Ltd commenced operations in 1995, with a modest polystyrene plant of 66,000 TPA capacity.
Yet, in less than a decade and a half, the company became the undisputed leader in polystyrene in India, with a market share exceeding 50%.
Its installed capacity has grown to 300,000 TPA effectively making SPL one of the largest single location PS producer in Asia. Exports have grown considerably too. Today the company proudly serves customers in more than 100 countries worldwide.
To widen its Styrenics spectrum, SPL forayed into production of EPS at multiple locations. The current installed capacity of EPS stands at 118,000 TPA.

From being a large commodity player, SPL is now increasingly operating as a supplier of value added products.
It has broken new grounds by developing specialty PP compounds for Appliances and Automotive applications. SPL expanded its masterbatch range to include White, Black, Colour, Filler and UV variants with various carrier resins.
Simultaneously SPL in 2007 started India’s first and only integrated plant of XPS (Extruded Polystyrene) Insulation foam boards to support and promote Green Building movement in India and are registered with IGBC and GRIHA.
