Established in 1959, we have evolved into a global leader in advanced materials, providing innovative solutions for industries such as footwear, automotive, ... | ECOVIVA® – Compostable Packaging Solutions | Dongsung Chemical announced on the 28th that, in collaboration with Cosmax, a leading global cosmetics original design manufacturer (ODM), it has successfully commercialized Korea’s first bio-based hot melt adhesive incorporating biodegradable bioplastic PHA.The two companies spent the past two years jointly developing the adhesive, which is now being used in cosmetic packaging. This milestone represents a significant step forward, combining sustainability with functionality.The adhesive, developed by Dongsung Chemical, contains 56% naturally derived ingredients—including PHA—and has received ‘bio-based’ certification from DIN CERTCO, a globally recognized German certification body. PHA is a polymer produced via microbial fermentation and is known to degrade by more than 90% within a year under natural conditions such as soil and seawater.Cosmax has adopted the adhesive in its production of shadow and cushion foundation packaging, successfully bonding aluminum containers to plastic outer shells. While the cosmetics industry has long sought alternatives to petroleum-based adhesives due to concerns over carbon dioxide emissions and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), achieving effective adhesion has remained a persistent challenge.Dongsung Chemical plans to expand its line of bio hot melt adhesives to sectors including cosmetics, household goods, electronics, and food packaging. By leveraging its proprietary resin formulation and synthesis technologies, the company aims to deliver tailored solutions for diverse client needs.“We are committed to building a sustainable packaging ecosystem in Korea, centered around the Bioplastic Complex—Korea’s only bioplastics innovation hub—which opened in Ulsan in 2024,” said Kim GeunMo, Director of Dongsung Chemical’s Bioplastics Division. “We also plan to release additional compostable adhesive products as we continue refining this technology.”Meanwhile, Cosmax plans to transition all hot melt adhesives used in its cosmetic containers to bio-based alternatives and expand their application from the domestic market to global markets. This effort is part of the company’s broader “2030 Plastics Initiative,” announced in 2023. | Dongsung Chemical, an eco-friendly materials science company, on April 30, announced the grand opening of its new polyurethane (PU) production facility in Karawang, Indonesia.The completion of the plant was marked by a ceremony attended by over 200 guests, including key leaders and dignitaries from Korea and Indonesia. Notable attendees included Dongsung Chemical Chairman Jeong-Ho Baek, CEOs Jin-Woo Baek and Man-Woo Lee, Indonesian Minister of Investment and Downstream Industry Rosan Perkasa Roeslani, and Acting Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Indonesia Su-Deok Park.Construction of the Karawang facility began in September 2023. Trial production was completed earlier this year, with full-scale operations commencing in February 2025.Spanning 81,000 square meters, the new plant boasts an annual production capacity of 67,000 tons of prepolymers, polyester polyols, and polyurethane resins, tripling the output of Dongsung Chemical’s existing PU plants in Korea, Vietnam, and China. It is also expected to generate approximately 150 million USD in annual revenue.The plant is also equipped with storage capacity for up to 1,000 tons of essential PU raw materials, ensuring supply chain stability and uninterrupted production, even in the face of global disruptions. Advanced automation systems further improve operational efficiency and product quality.Positioned in one of Indonesia’s key industrial zones, the plant will serve as a strategic base for Dongsung Chemical’s global expansion, particularly across Southeast Asia, the Americas, and Europe. Beyond its existing footprint in footwear, synthetic leather, automotive, and electronics, the company plans to enter the furniture materials market.During the business overview presentation, CEO Man-Woo Lee outlined the company’s ambitious global strategy: “By capitalizing on Indonesia’s logistical advantages—its proximity to major ports and pivotal position in the automotive supply chain—we plan to deliver high-quality products to our customers with speed and efficiency. This new facility will serve as a key launching pad for Dongsung Chemical’s global expansion.”Chairman Jeong-Ho Baek added, “This plant will become the leading PU production base in Southeast Asia and a vital hub in our global network. We remain committed to creating exceptional value through innovation and sustainable practices.”Indonesian Minister Rosan Perkasa Roeslani commented, “I would like to emphasize our Ministry’s commitment to continue facilitating and supporting quality investments in Indonesia, including through streamlined licensing, strengthened coordination, and improved investment climate.”', hall = '6', stand = 'C52', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Minsoo Kim", "role": "Bio Packaging Solution", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T00:37:30.515911', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

Nuova Idropress S.p.A.
NUOVA IDROPRESS S.p.A., founded in 1963, designs, manufactures and installs complete systems and machines for the production, processing and recovery of EPS since 50 years.
It is therefore one of the oldest companies, which is dealing with machines for industrial generation of EPS boards since the invention of EPS in the 50th and the commercial introduction of insulation boards in the 60th.

The Company, at the moment has two plants with a total surface area of 15.000 m2 where approximately 110 people are employed as technicians and workers. In 1971 it made the first of more than 600 Vertical Block Moulding machines produced to date and all of which are still operating throughout the world.
The will to grow and the constant technical research brought us to expand our Department of Development Research and Customer Service.

This is a feather in our cap as we rely on more than 30 experienced engineers that design on last generation software in 3D (mechanical part), realize the software for PLC and Machine Supervision (on PC) that are at the base of the functioning of our Machinery and they deal with the start-up of the Plants, as well as the post-sales service (via internet) ensuring a support to the customers in fundamental languages.
From the moment that we think that selling a plant is only the starting point of a profitable collaboration with a Customer, it follows that a structure of adequate technical support results for us an indispensable point to apply to the base of growth of our Company that proceeds at the same pace with the full satisfaction of our Customers.

Nowadays the machines of Nuova Idropress are working in 50 countries worldwide, in 5 continents and NUOVA IDROPRESS S.p.A. is the market leader and the main supplier of many of the main industrial groups of EPS producers for insulation materials.
