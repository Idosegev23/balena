From the initial idea to the recycled product at full speed - prototyping
R', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Lamy and HolyPoly have won one of the coveted awards at the world''s largest trade fair for plastic recycling, the Plastics Recycling Show Europe. In the category "Household & Leisure Product," the aquaplus re paint box, which we developed together with C. Josef Lamy GmbH, was named the winner.The paint box is made of 99.4% recycled plastic (rPS) and proves that sustainable products are possible without compromising on quality or price. And as if that weren''t enough, the LAMY aquaplus re is also a real eye-catcher: its marble design makes each product unique - and shows the entire industry just how stylish successful plastic recycling can be.The paint box is certified according to the toy standard DIN EN 71-3 and is offered at retail at the same price as the sister model made from virgin plastic. As the starting point for LAMY''s plastic transition, the development of this recycled paint box answered fundamental questions about technical properties, legal requirements, and material availability. Now, the project can serve as a blueprint for transforming the entire product range. | International technology group ANDRITZ, a leading supplier to the pulp and paper industry, has signed an exclusive cooperation agreement with the German recycling pioneer HolyPoly to provide a comprehensive recycling solution for used paper machine clothing to paper producers across Europe. The new service enables mills to recycle all forming fabrics and felts at the end of their service life, contributing to a more circular economy.Under this first-of-its-kind agreement, HolyPoly, a specialist in the recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, has been licensed by ANDRITZ to collect used paper machine clothing (PMC) from paper mills and recycle it.Currently, a total of 7,000 tons of PMC is discarded from paper machines in Europe each year. Most of this waste is incinerated or, in some cases, landfilled. The new agreement between ANDRITZ and HolyPoly provides an immediate solution for the recycling of PMC and contributes to increasing the circularity of post-consumer waste in paper production."We worked intensively with universities and plastics recycling experts to develop a suitable solution for recycling PMC. Once we had it, we needed an experienced partner to scale up the process and bring the concept to life," said Jan Freudenberg, Director R&D Forming Fabrics, ANDRITZ. "HolyPoly is the perfect fit for our concept. They have the necessary waste removal certifications, logistics networks, and know-how to bring used PMC into the circular economy."Niklas Bäumer, Project Owner Recycling Programs, HolyPoly, said, "We are delighted to be working with ANDRITZ on PMC recycling and impressed by their commitment to providing customers with sustainable solutions. This is a pioneering joint project, with both companies dedicated to solving important challenges in the European paper industry''s circularity. With our new service, paper mills can be assured that their used PMC will be properly recycled, and their high-quality plastics will be used in new products."As part of the service, PMC from ANDRITZ and all other OEMs and manufacturers can be collected and recycled through HolyPoly''s extensive network of recycling operations and partners. HolyPoly is a young German company with a dedicated team of plastics recycling experts who recognize the significant value of discarded post-consumer waste. The company has extensive knowledge in waste collection, logistics and processes involved in the recycling and utilization of recycled plastics. | Exhibitors & Products | Digital Services Act (DSA)', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Matthias Röder", "role": "Head of Marketing", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Fridolin Pflüger", "role": "Managing Director", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Stefan Canditt", "role": "Sales Manager", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Laura Cordes", "role": "CRO & Director Circular Business Design", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T01:20:27.865948', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

This evolution, far from being a technological upgrade, represents a fundamental shift in how we design, produce, and manage goods. Understanding this progression, from the earliest factory workshop to the sophisticated smart factory, is essential for any business aiming to thrive in the modern industrial era.From Manual Labour to Automated EfficiencyThe story begins with the manual workshop, a world where human skill and experience are the primary drivers of production. While offering flexibility and low initial costs, this stage is inherently limited by human capacity for error, fatigue, and the sheer pace of production. The subsequent step, the lights out factory, marks a significant leap forward. Here, the fully automated factory no longer relies on human labour for production, and as such light is no longer needed. Machines take the reins of repetitive tasks, boosting speed, consistency, and safety. However, this increased efficiency often operates within predefined parameters, lacking the agility needed for true responsiveness. The Dawn of Digitalisation: Data as the New CurrencyThis shift to industrial automation happens in parallel with the development of digitalised factory. The undigitalised factory, still reliant on manual records, soon gives way to the paperless digitalised factory. This pivotal stage sees the introduction of digital systems like MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning). Suddenly, data becomes more than just records;
