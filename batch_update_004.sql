Our equipment is built with 100% U.S.-sourced components and is known worldwide for its durability and high performance. | Jomar Corporation, the leading global manufacturer of injection blow molding (IBM) machinery, has acquired the assets of a local mold making company, enabling the in-house offering of mold and packaging designs, mold creation, and total turnkey solutions for its injection blow molding machinery. The company has set aside a portion of its 50,000 square feet of manufacturing space at its US headquarters in Pleasantville, NJ to be dedicated to mold design, development, and production.  ‚ÄúWe are very excited to have received board approval for this acquisition and expansion‚Äú notes Carlos Castro, President of Jomar. ‚ÄúAs part of the Indel diversified group, Jomar benefits from being able to respond quickly to market opportunities like this one when they appear. We became aware of the availability of these mold making assets and were able to quickly structure an offer. Jomar has long offered tooling and turnkey services, but in the past those have involved partnering with proven subcontractors, which we will continue to do. But going forward, we will have these capabilities in-house and will now be able to offer them to customers at significantly lower pricing.‚Äù     This means process engineers will be involved at every stage of the development process.
