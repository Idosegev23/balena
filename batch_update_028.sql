EFLAYA SRL
We were born from the union of different companies and experiences, from the history of market leaders such as Sovere (since 1976 in PVC) and CM Manzoni (since 1965), a leading company in vulcanized rubber, to part of the former Softer Management .eflaya is the result of various aggregation initiatives, both mergers and acquisitions (e.g. with Sol Termoplasticos in Mexico ) and joint ventures (e.g. with Montelur in Uruguay) and actual start-ups (e.g. the TPE plant in Fusignano, Italy). Eflaya is also a synergistic and unified brand.

Our goal is to quickly become a "pocket-sized multinational", with a global presence in strategic locations for compound production and local distribution, while maintaining the flexibility and responsiveness typical of an SME.

Our production spectrum ranges from TPE (with SBS , SEBS , TPV), TPU to PVC . The ability to produce customized materials with polymer alloys based on specific customer requirements enables us to comprehensively cover the most diverse and specialized requirements.
Eflaya goes beyond the simple sales offer and presents itself as a solution provider able to develop the most suitable product together with the customer after understanding and analyzing their needs.
