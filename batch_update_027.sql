Licharz GmbH
We research, develop and manufacture for you
INNOVATIONS: since 1962

We are specialized in the production of semi-finished products made of engineering plastics. Our main focus is the production of LiNNOTAM, a very strong, durable cast polyamide from our own development. POM and PET complete our program. Over 7000 tons of engineering plastics per year - that is our volume. We are among the top manufacturers worldwide.

Long-lasting materials, individual cuts, variety in dimensions - these are the top priorities here. Incidentally, the art of polyamide and semifinished product production lies in good formulations and precisely adapted
Production plants. That''s why, for us, recipe development and plant setup go hand in hand.

The engineering plastics PA, POM and PET are innovative substitutes for metals because they are wear-resistant, easy to glide and easy to machine. It''s no wonder, then, that they are now the starting product for a wide variety of parts and components in mechanical engineering and industrial

Where today construction crane, conveyor technology or food processing is on it, not rarely Licharz is in it.
At our company headquarters in Buchholz in the Westerwald region, we are the second generation to develop formulations for engineering plastics and manufacture semi-finished products and structural parts for a wide variety of industries and markets.

TOPLINE MK2 - Modular high-pressure metering machines of the next generation for the most demanding and highly automated special applications
HIGHLINE MK2 - ', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | PANELMASTER STEEL - Turnkey plant technology for the continuous production of sandwich panels with rigid facings and a core structure made of polyurethane or mineral wool | Hennecke GROUP at the K Trade Fair 2025: Innovative solutions drive FOCUS2030 strategy forward | From October 8 to 15, 2025, the Hennecke GROUP will showcase its role as a leading innovation driver in the polyurethane industry at the K Trade Fair in Düsseldorf (Hall 13/ BoothB63). At the heart of the presentation: the new FOCUS2030 corporate strategy and a portfolio of cutting-edge technologies that set new benchmarks in efficiency, sustainability, and digitalization. FOCUS2030: Strategic roadmap for sustainable growthFollowing a record-breaking year in 2024, the Hennecke GROUP is entering its next growth phase with the launch of FOCUS2030. This long-term strategy emphasizes responsible business practices, targeted expansion, technological excellence, and a globally oriented organizational structure with specialized competence centers and integrated system solutions that follow a tailor-made Local-for-Local approach. “With FOCUS2030, we are actively shaping change and aligning our business model with the customer demands of the future,” says Thomas Wildt, CEO of the Hennecke GROUP. Technological highlights: Innovation meets sustainabilityFor Hennecke, responsible business means conserving resources and maximizing efficiency. Since the last K Trade Fair, more than 25 new and further developments in the Hennecke GROUP''s product portfolio impressively embody this philosophy. The focus of the trade fair presentation is on four new product generations that demonstrate how technological innovation contributes directly to sustainability and economic performance. The new SMARTFLEX evo continuous slabstock line bridges the gap between JFLEX evo and MULTIFLEX, offering a high-performance, cost-effective entry into large-scale comfort foam production. Its modular design and high degree of standardization significantly reduce investment and operating costs, while proven high-pressure metering technology ensures efficient raw material usage.  In the automated production of energy-efficient insulation using rigid PUR foam, the new HIGHLINE MK2 TI SERIES high-pressure metering machine enables faster, more precise mould filling and reliable processing of blowing agents such as pentane and modern flammable and non-flammable HFO formulations. This significantly improves process and product quality as well as cycle times, especially when using highly reactive and demanding rigid foam systems. As part of the Local-for-Local approach of the FOCUS2030 strategy, the machine is offered worldwide with identical performance data, but its technical design is specifically adapted to the respective market requirements. This flexibility makes the TI SERIES particularly appealing to global customers, especially in rapidly growing Asian markets. A version already available for the APAC region underscores this impressively. The all-electric PANELMASTER STEEL sets new standards in sandwich panel production, with a capacity of up to 2,000,000 square meters per year. The newly developed MiWo concept for mineral wool processing establishes a new global benchmark. The ECOFILLER PLUS MK2 represents a major step toward waste-free production. This system enables the efficient recycling of production waste directly into the manufacturing process of PUR sandwich elements, conserving valuable resources and reducing environmental impact. Digitalization as a key technologyAll new product generations are equipped with the advanced FOAMATIC and FOAMWARE control solutions. FOAMATIC combines a modern HMI with a powerful PLC and enables particularly simple and error-free operation thanks to its intuitive “three-click philosophy.” As a PC-based solution, FOAMWARE offers maximum transparency in continuous processes, especially in industrial environments with large data volumes and high demands. Both systems actively contribute to resource conservation and increased efficiency. Service and retrofittingIn addition to new technologies, Hennecke will present its comprehensive 360°SERVICE portfolio at the K Trade Fair. This includes the 360°SMART Service Portal and a range of innovative retrofit solutions that allow customers worldwide to modernize existing systems and significantly boost efficiency. Another highlight is the new service consulting under 360°ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, which provides expert guidance on process optimization and production reliability. Visitors can also learn more about the newly available FOAMWARE Complete Care service package. This modular offering gives slabstock producers maximum predictability and production reliability, aligning seamlessly with the 360°SERVICE philosophy. The goal: smooth production operations and long-term partnerships. Digital machine configuration with the #nextgenstoreWith the new online configurator NEXT-GEN Store, Hennecke becomes the first supplier worldwide to offer the possibility of configuring PUR metering machines individually and according to requirements - conveniently online or as a special highlight directly at the Hennecke trade fair stand. Under the motto "Your Machine. Your Configuration. Live at K Show", visitors will experience how easily and quickly a suitable solution can be put together for many possible application scenarios. The intuitive web interface enables quick configuration and immediately shows the current delivery times for all available markets. Curious visitors can even create their personal configuration before the trade fair at hennecke.com/configurator, note down the configuration code and find out directly at the booth why placing an order at the K Trade Fair is twice as worthwhile.  The Hennecke experts are looking forward to showing visitors customized solutions at the K 2025 Trade Fair. Visit booth B63 in hall 13 to find out more about how we can shape the future of the polyurethane industry together.
