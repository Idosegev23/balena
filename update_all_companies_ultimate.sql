Avoiding incineration and substituting fossil oil makes a significant contribution to climate protection and resource conservation. As the energy required for the process is supplied exclusively by electrically driven friction mixers, the carboliq® process can be qualified as a "net-zero technology" when using green electricity. carboliq® is based in Remscheid. A pilot plant is being operated at the waste disposal center in Ennigerloh. The construction of a first industrial plant is planned at the Chempark Dormagen. carboliq® GmbH has developed a process for oiling plastics of different fractions in which the necessary energy is introduced into the process exclusively through mechanical friction. This results in very low energy consumption for chemical recycling processes. With 100% renewable electricity, the process is also completely CO2 -neutral. High yields of more than 80% can be achieved. The petroleum substitute product obtained is a virgin raw material that can be used, for example, to produce new plastic granulates.

BioCote®’s extensive portfolio of antimicrobial additives includes silver, zinc, and organic compounds, as well as combinations such as silver/zinc blends. Working without an off switch, the technology has demonstrated an 86% reduction in microbes in only 15 minutes and a 99.9% reduction in 24 hours. The antimicrobial additives can be easily and cost-effectively integrated into a wide variety of polymer materials, formulations, and polymer blends during manufacturing without affecting the colour or mechanical properties of the material. Offering an extensive variety of antimicrobial additives for engineering plastics and commodity polymers in concentrated powder or masterbatch form, the company has the capability to create bespoke polymer-specific masterbatches to meet any moulding or extrusion process. Designed to have antimicrobial efficacy at low dosage rates, BioCote®’s powder and masterbatch additives do not affect the overall structure of a polymer. This means, if a polymer is recyclable, the addition of BioCote® will not influence its recyclability. ⁠What’s even better, once incorporated into a product, BioCote®’s additives work continuously to protect against odour formation, staining and material degradation caused by microbes.

With five production facilities in Japan, China, Thailand, and Pakistan, we ensure global supply of identical specifications and stable quality. Today, Nippon Talc products are trusted by customers in more than 37 countries worldwide. At K2025, we are highlighting our latest innovations that combine sustainability and high performance. One of our newest developments is the KUROTALC Series, designed specifically for black-colored plastics. Traditionally, adding white talc to black resins caused greying and loss of appearance quality. KUROTALC maintains deep black coloration while providing talc’s reinforcement benefits, and it can partially replace carbon black to achieve cost reduction. This innovation is ideal for automotive interiors, home appliances, and other black applications requiring both aesthetics and functionality.
