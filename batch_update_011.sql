Carboliq GmbH
Carboliq® GmbH has developed a process for the oiling of mixed and contaminated waste plastics. This allows the hydrocarbons contained in the waste to be regenerated and made available to industry in liquid form for the production of new, high-quality plastics. Avoiding incineration and substituting fossil oil makes a significant contribution to climate protection and resource conservation. As the energy required for the process is supplied exclusively by electrically driven friction mixers, the carboliq® process can be qualified as a "net-zero technology" when using green electricity. carboliq® is based in Remscheid. A pilot plant is being operated at the waste disposal center in Ennigerloh. The construction of a first industrial plant is planned at the Chempark Dormagen.

carboliq® GmbH has developed a process for oiling plastics of different fractions in which the necessary energy is introduced into the process exclusively through mechanical friction. This results in very low energy consumption for chemical recycling processes. With 100% renewable electricity, the process is also completely CO2 -neutral. High yields of more than 80% can be achieved. The petroleum substitute product obtained is a virgin raw material that can be used, for example, to produce new plastic granulates. This can reduce the use of fossil raw materials in the plastics industry. These granulates are also suitable for the production of new, high-performance films that can be used for packaging demanding products with high quality and hygiene requirements

Ztech Plastic Machinery Manufacturing Co.,Ltd.
Ztech’s Innovative Solutions Showcased at K 2025 Germany
 Ztech Plastic Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd. returns to K 2025 in Düsseldorf, Germany, from October 8-15, focusing on its cutting-edge technologies at Booth 4D25 in Hall 04. As a key player in the global bubble film machinery sector, Ztech brings its expertise, with a presence in 120+ countries and success stories spanning Europe, Asia, and the Americas, to this prestigious event.
 K 2025, a leading exhibition in the plastics and rubber industry, attracts professionals worldwide, serving as the perfect platform for Ztech to highlight its latest advancements. Central to its presentation is the upgraded ABA Bubble Film Machine, built on Ztech’s 2015 breakthrough in ABA coextrusion technology—a innovation that redefined traditional extrusion solutions that had stood unchallenged for nearly a century.
 This ABA machine excels with advanced coextrusion capabilities, using HDPE and PP to deliver superior hardness and texture while significantly reducing costs. Its fully automated operation, from material feeding to bubble formation and winding, minimizes manual intervention, lowering error risks and boosting efficiency. Key strengths include high-performance bubble rollers with micro-finished surfaces for stable bubble structure, and advanced winders that maintain precise tension to eliminate telescoping or wrinkling.
 Committed to sustainability, the ABA machine supports 100% PLA (biodegradable) and 100% recycled materials, aligning with global eco-friendly trends. Beyond this, Ztech’s portfolio includes the 4.2-meter widest bubble film extrusion line—developed in 2023—alongside high-speed models (over 100m/min) and customized solutions like nylon coextrusion systems, all tailored to diverse production needs.

Ztech’s reputation for reliability stems from top-tier manufacturing facilities, featuring advanced CNC machining and automated systems. All products hold CE, UL, and CSA certifications, meeting strict international standards.
 Visit Ztech at Booth 4D25 to connect with technical experts, explore customized solutions, and discover how its innovations can elevate your production processes. At K 2025, Ztech offers insights into the future of efficient, sustainable bubble film manufacturing.
