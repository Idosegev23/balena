DDL srl
DDL SRL started its operations in 2001 by serving both the Italian and export markets.
The main activity of the Company was to design and to manufacture  EPS turn-key plants .
As time passed new technologies were added to the basic ones, like the automatic wires positioning, oscillating wires and double regulation block mould.
In a short time DDL acquired the characteristics of being able to offer a very large production range of machines.
The production range has improved with the introduction of  robots and paletizing system  for EPS and XPS.
In 2015, besides our customers,  Thermobonding  thechnology was developed.
In 2017 the know-how acquired allowed us improve our range with the most advanced and automated  XPS post-processing line  on the market.
In 2025 we moved to our new 4000 sqm plant.
Nowadays the Company has an experienced technical department who is able to provide a continuous technical growth of products and to design tailor-made solutions.
Since 2001 over 200 plants has been installed in more than 30 countries all over the world.
