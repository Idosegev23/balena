With a strong focus on performance polymers, circularity, decarbonization and lightweighting. Omya will showcase a portfolio of sustainable solutions to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. Visit Omya at Hall 6, Booth D75. A key highlight is the launch of  Omya Performance Polymers Distribution (OPPD). Formed earlier this year, OPPD combines Omya’s global polymer distribution network with Distrupol, enhancing the company’s ability to serve a dynamic global market with a comprehensive range of high-performance polymers. Fostering Decarbonization with Mineral ExpertiseOmya’s advanced calcium carbonate solutions lower the carbon footprint and improve performance of plastic products. The company offers pre-consumer recycled grades, including Omyaloop FC for general purpose applications and Omya Smartfill 55-AV for engineering materials and biopolymers, verified by Bureau Veritas and produced using green electricity. These grades reduce emissions by up to two-thirds and support compliance with EU sustainability directives.“Our mineral solutions reduce environmental impact while enhancing performance” said Marco Viel, Vice President of Polymers. Lightweighting for Performance and EfficiencyOmya’s hollow glass microspheres — Omyasphere 900 series are engineered to significantly reduce product weight while maintaining strength. These lightweight fillers are ideal for automotive, aerospace, and electronics, offering improved flow, higher filler loading, and enhanced thermal and dielectric performance. They support dimensional stability and are suitable for advanced polymer and construction applications. Performance meets sustainability in hygiene market New Omyafilm developments enable the production of thinner films without compromising process stability or product quality. Meanwhile, Omyafiber is commercialized to the nonwovens, textiles and carpets industry delivering not only the general advantages of reduced material costs and lower environmental impact, but also technical benefits.

NIPPON TALC CO., LTD.
Founded in 1934, Nippon Talc Co., Ltd. has supported global industries for over 90 years as a specialized manufacturer of mineral fillers. Our high-quality talc and other mineral-based fillers are used in plastics, rubber, coatings, adhesives, electronic materials, cosmetics, and food additives. With five production facilities in Japan, China, Thailand, and Pakistan, we ensure global supply of identical specifications and stable quality. Today, Nippon Talc products are trusted by customers in more than 37 countries worldwide.
At K2025, we are highlighting our latest innovations that combine sustainability and high performance. One of our newest developments is the KUROTALC Series, designed specifically for black-colored plastics. Traditionally, adding white talc to black resins caused greying and loss of appearance quality. KUROTALC maintains deep black coloration while providing talc’s reinforcement benefits, and it can partially replace carbon black to achieve cost reduction. This innovation is ideal for automotive interiors, home appliances, and other black applications requiring both aesthetics and functionality.
Another breakthrough is the TKD Scallop Powder Series, representing our commitment to circular economy and CO₂ reduction. Derived from scallop shells and produced without the traditional calcination process, TKD achieves significant CO₂ savings. With a mild pH of 9.3 compared to 13.4 for calcined products, it improves workplace safety, while odor and chlorine are removed for clean handling. With more than 96% purity in CaCO₃, TKD provides superior bending modulus and toughness compared to limestone-derived fillers. It offers broad application potential in plastics, rubber, coatings, detergents, and deodorants.
In the field of flame retardants, we present Magnesium Hydroxide (Mg(OH)₂), a halogen-free inorganic solution. Upon heating, it decomposes endothermically to release water vapor, cooling the material, diluting flammable gases, and reducing smoke generation significantly. Synthetic grades with ≥98% purity deliver excellent dispersibility, while natural grades provide cost efficiency. Optional stearic acid and silane treatments further enhance dispersion and compatibility with resins such as PE, PP, PVC, and EVA. Importantly, Mg(OH)₂ also demonstrates strong suitability for recycled plastics, supporting sustainable material cycles in line with global regulations.
We also highlight the Nano Ace Series, an ultrafine talc with established applications in nucleating agents and electronic adhesives. As a nucleating agent, Nano Ace accelerates crystallization in PP and PET, enabling shorter molding cycles and improved stiffness and dimensional stability. In electronic adhesives, it delivers thixotropy control, improved cohesive strength, and shrinkage resistance. Emerging studies also report excellent effects in PLA-based 3D printing, such as reduced warpage, improved rigidity, and higher thermal stability. This positions Nano Ace as both a proven solution and a promising material for next-generation applications.
Through these developments, Nippon Talc continues to innovate as a leading global mineral filler manufacturer, offering solutions that balance performance with environmental responsibility. At K2025, we invite you to explore our full product portfolio—from sustainable fillers and halogen-free flame retardants to next-generation additives for adhesives, nucleation, and 3D printing. With a robust global network and five production bases, we deliver consistent quality, reliable supply, and technologies that support a sustainable future.
