Terbrack Kunststoff GmbH & Co. KG
Future-oriented from the very beginning.

For more than 60 years TERBRACK has been known as a pioneer in the production and processing of high-quality engineering plastics.

Already at its foundation in 1954 TERBRACK started innovatively and was the first company to process so-called ultra-high molecular weight and high molecular weight polyethylenes. Customers all over the world benefit from these products from Vreden in Münsterland, which are initially manufactured as pressed sheets at TERBRACK and then further processed into finished parts that can be found in almost the entire machinery and plant engineering sector.

Extruded profiles and round bars as chain and belt guides, guide rails and sliding strips complement or extend the manufacturing and thus the application possibilities.

In particular, ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylenes, which are, incidentally, an extraordinarily special material among plastics, represent a significant advantage due to their outstanding sliding properties, low mechanical wear, the extremely high impact strength as well as the good chemical resistance, they can be used in a wide range of applications as lining elements in silo and bunker linings, ships and trucks, in filling and packaging plants, in transport, storage and conveyor technology, in chemical and electroplating technology as seals, sliding and guide rollers, gear wheels for fittings as well as in the food industry, etc. are also used.

Reliable quality, selected raw materials as well as strict and permanent controls during the entire process chain guarantee the quality of our products
In addition, our qualities comply with the valid food regulations. (EU 10/2011/EG;

VEKA AG Ein Unternehmen der Laumann Gruppe
Quality as a principle

As the world market leader for PVC window and door profiles, VEKA is also the guarantor of unconditional quality for VEKAPLAN sheet systems. Because only a product of consistently high quality enables problem-free processing and reliably meets all requirements in practice. To ensure this quality, we continuously carry out strict controls along the entire production chain - from the testing of the delivered raw materials in our in-house laboratory and regular color matching to the final inspection of the extruded sheets and foiling.

The success story of VEKA AG began in 1969, and the company has grown to become the global market leader for plastic profiles, sheets and moulding systems. With 38 subsidiaries, further successful chapters have been added. One of them is called VEKAPLAN. Since 1985, an independent division for plastic sheets has been able to establish itself on the market worldwide under this name

A company is always as good as its employees. For this simple but decisive reason, VEKA focuses on the greatest possible qualification in the selection, education and training of its employees. After all, VEKAPLAN partners rightly expect the highest level of performance, service and competence.

Partnership - the wishes of our customers represent the central orientation for all our actions.

The mission of Cumapol is to produce sustainable thermoplastic Polyester specialties by combining the different recycling technologies, close the Polyester loop and create a high performance product without using fossil based chemicals.

Cumapol Emmen is a toll converter serving the PET industry by converting amorphous, low IV modified Polyesters into valuable PET grades suitable for the intended application.

Cumapol offers different services in Polyester upgrading: Regranulation, Compounding, Crystallization and Solid State Polymerization for a wide range of virgin and recycled Polyesters. Cumapol has the positive expert opinion from EFSA, which means that recycled material processed by Cumapol can be reused in most direct food contact applications.

In 2013, we started with the recycling of post-consumer bottles, back into a bottle grade suitable for direct food contact and the development of special grades based on recycled materials. Nowadays, 50% of our capacity is occupied with the upgrading of recycled PET and 50% with virgin specialties with experience in PET, Copolyesters, PBT, PEF, etc.

We are continuously improving our custom made Polyesters based on mechanical recycling. With the start of exploring chemical recycling and the use of bio-based monomers we made the next steps in circularity but we have many plans to improve, please check our website www.cumapol.com or contact us for any questions.
