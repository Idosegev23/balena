Edilteco at K 2025: Industrial EPS', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Edilteco – Italian technology for advanced EPS processing | Edilteco at K 2025: Industrial EPS Technology for High-Performance Insulation | Edilteco returns to K 2025, the world’s leading trade fair for plastics and rubber, reaffirming its role as a key player in the industrial transformation of expanded polystyrene (EPS) for the building sector. With over 40 years of research, development, and global partnerships, Edilteco has established itself as a technological benchmark in the production of thermal insulation materials using EPS. Its presence at K 2025 highlights a unique industrial offering: complete production systems for manufacturing high-performance, lightweight insulating products on a global scale. A Fully Integrated Industrial Approach Edilteco designs and constructs complete industrial plants for EPS processing, providing end-to-end solutions that cover the entire production cycle — from raw EPS expansion to the coating, mixing, and packaging of insulation compounds. This integrated system ensures absolute control over output quality, manufacturing efficiency, and adaptability to different regional market requirements. Exclusive Technology: The E.I.A. Additive A cornerstone of Edilteco’s process is the patented E.I.A. (Edilteco Insulation Additive), which coats each EPS bead to ensure stable and homogeneous bonding with cement-based mixtures. This additive eliminates flotation and separation issues typical of untreated EPS, allowing for faster startup (within 45 days), consistent results, and the production of lightweight, thermally efficient mortars ready for the construction industry. A Complete Range of EPS Production Plants Edilteco’s portfolio includes several dedicated production lines designed for scalability and industrial performance: ·        EPS Expansion Plant – For the automated transformation of raw EPS into high-quality, lightweight beads ·        Politerm® Evolution Plant – For coating EPS beads with E.I.A. for use in thermal insulating mortars ·        Drymix Plant – For blending and bagging ready-to-use lightweight EPS-based mortars ·        ECAP® Plant – For producing prefinished EPS insulation boards for external wall insulation (EWI) systems ·        Smartblocks Plant – For the manufacture of lightweight insulating EPS-concrete blocks for the building sector Each system is designed for efficient, high-volume production with minimal labor, making them ideal for manufacturers seeking scalable and sustainable insulation solutions. Partnering for Growth With over 50 licensed partners around the world, Edilteco provides a strategic model for industrial growth. Partners benefit from access to Edilteco’s know-how, technical support, and product evolution, enabling them to introduce top-tier EPS insulation products into their markets quickly and efficiently. At K 2025, Edilteco welcomes manufacturers and investors interested in discovering how this technology can become a platform for expansion, innovation, and leadership in energy-efficient construction. Edilteco is more than a supplier—it is a global partner in insulation technology. | A sign of continuity, with a focus on the future. Rosacometta, a historic company specializing in the production of machines for concrete blocks and elements, now part of the Edilteco Group, presents its new logo and website: two symbols of an evolution that strongly combines tradition and innovation.

The booth focuses on innovation, co-creation and sustainability: Visitors can explore the latest ISCC PLUS-certified materials and see how Kuraray works with customers to create future-ready solutions for mobility, packaging, and healthcare. | Innovative high-performance materials from Kuraray support the mobility transition | K 2025: Sustainable materials and solutions for the automotive industry Hattersheim/Frankfurt am Main, 18 June 2025. Kuraray, the global speciality chemicals company headquartered in Japan, markets innovative and sustainable high-performance materials for demanding applications in the automotive industry. Kuraray therefore helps OEMs and suppliers actively shape the transition to emissions-free mobility, circularity and regulatory compliance. GENESTAR™ is suitable for wear-proof bearings, lightweight drivetrain components and heat management in electric vehicles. KURARAY LIQUID RUBBER improves the rolling resistance of tyres and also reduces production time and costs, while MOWITAL® enables heat separable (reversible) lamination of composite structures. PMMA-based products such as PARAPET™ and KURALPHA™ offer solutions for recyclable rear lights, heat-resistant head-up displays and recycling of coated automotive parts as well as parts covered with decorative film. EVAL™ EVOH, by contrast, is used as a barrier layer in hydrogen tank systems. Kuraray is presenting these and other innovations at K 2025 in Düsseldorf Germany (October 8-15, 2025, Hall 7a, Booth D06), where visitors can experience the automotive solutions at first hand. | KURARAY POVAL™ and MOWITAL ® from Frankfurt am Main, Germany, are verifiably bio-based Hattersheim, January 14, 2025. Kuraray, the global speciality chemicals company headquartered in Japan, has obtained ISCC PLUS certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) for its two production plants in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The associated audit, which was performed by Berlin-based Control Union, comprised an audit of the products KURARAY POVAL™ (polyvinyl alcohol, PVA/PVOH) and MOWITAL ® (polyvinyl butyral resin, PVB resin). ISCC PLUS is a globally recognised voluntary sustainability certificate awarded, among others, for the plastics and chemicals markets. Its aim is to provide clear evidence of the sustainability of all raw materials along the entire value chain of a product. Certification enables Kuraray to meet the growing demand from customers for traceable evidence of the sustainability of KURARAY POVAL™ and MOWITAL ® .
