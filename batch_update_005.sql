UL International Germany GmbH
Global safety, performance and compliance leadership

Plastics have become almost inseparable from daily life. Global manufacturers of plastics, resins and other engineered materials continue to innovate toward a safer, more sustainable world, while additive manufacturing is redefining what we once thought possible in both finished products and the manufacturing processes.

Manufacturers are increasingly challenged to develop more environmentally-friendly products and processes while meeting changing customer expectations and satisfying OEM requirements. And as innovation continues to pick up pace, you also need to be confident in the safety and performance of new materials.

We can help. At UL Solutions, we apply our scientific expertise and data to everything from material selection and product design to large-scale production and end-of-life. Our Plastics Recognition Program is globally recognized and can help you demonstrate the safety, quality and suitability of your materials based on a specific set of third-party performance credentials.

The UL Solutions certification materials (UL Solutions Yellow Card® and UL Solutions Blue Card®) can also be used to market and differentiate your products and help downstream manufacturers save valuable time testing end-products. For recycled plastic content, the UL Component Recognition program provides the services needed to maintain the integrity of material certifications.

We will work with your team to help you overcome manufacturing challenges, comply with regulatory requirements and bring safer products to the global market as quickly as possible.

Therefore BYK will end its production of additives containing PFAS and will be shipping the last batch of the affected products by the end of 2025. By then, we will also be offering PFAS-free solutions for applications in which, currently, additives containing PFAS are still used.Even today, the percentage of PFAS-containing additives in BYK''s extensive product portfolio is very small.
