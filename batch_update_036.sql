UWAY Extrusion LLC
With factory operations based in Warren, Ohio (USA), Uway Extrusion engineers and builds custom extrusion systems with outputs of up to 14,000 lbs/hr. Uway Extrusion is dedicated to making advancements in the plastic extrusion machinery industry. Whether it be engineering and building systems to fit in-line with thermoforming machinery or integrating compounding directly into the extrusion process, Uway Extrusion has the solutions for you.

Uway builds extrusion systems using simple designs and focusing only on the top component suppliers in order to provide our customers with dependable machinery that produces consistent, high quality and high volume output. Uway specializes in customized systems from the lab scal up to 7 tons per hour.

Having installations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa, Uway has a global view of our customers and therefore we use components that are of international standards. This means when maintenance does occur your staff will not have to spend time retrofitting parts. Downtime during maintenance will be reduced, maintenance expenses will be lower, and more time can be spent producing sellable product.

In 2014 Uway manufactured 64 sheet lines and approximately 130 twin-screw extruders. Much of Uway Extrusion’s success can be attributed to sole owner Dustin Kremer’s background. “Being third generation and having experience operating, maintaining and building the [extruders],” Kremer said, “I have a unique perspective on how to create the machinery to meet the customers’ needs. I focus on keeping the machinery simple and reliable, while making the extruders generic enough that parts can be locally sourced to prevent production delays.”
