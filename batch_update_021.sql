Fych Technologies S.L.
At Fych Technologies, we break through the barriers that keep complex plastics out of the circular economy.
We specialize in the mechanical recycling of the most difficult plastic waste, multi-layer films, laminated packaging and plastics with strong odors or contaminants that conventional recyclers cannot process. Our approach is based on two patented, solvent-free technologies developed exclusively by our team:

Delamination, which separates bonded layers of different polymers and materials.
Vapor decontamination, which removes over 96% of odors and contaminants without the use of toxic chemicals.

These technologies form the basis for our unique Advanced Mechanical Recycling Technology, which we have already validated through successful industrial pilot projects. Now we are expanding: our first industrial recycling plant with a processing capacity of 500 kg/h is currently under construction in Spain.

Our project "ReMLP - Recycling Multilayer Plastics" has been selected and funded by the European Innovation Council (EIC), recognizing not only our technological potential but also our industrial ambition. We are proud to hold the exclusive exploitation rights for these ground-breaking innovations.

We work closely with key players throughout the plastics value chain:
Plastic product manufacturers seeking recyclability
Plastics processors seeking sustainable and cost-effective solutions
Recyclers who want to process complex and contaminated materials
Distributors and packaging suppliers interested in recyclable alternatives
Brands and retailers looking to reduce their environmental impact
Research centers and innovation partners exploring future recycling models
Public institutions and private investors promoting green technologies

Our vision is to turn every complex plastic into a valuable resource.
Our goal is to make plastics recycling smarter, cleaner and more efficient - and todo thistogether with those who are ready to change the industry.

Let''s work together at K to shape the future of circular plastics!!!
