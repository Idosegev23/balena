Frilvam S.p.a.
A company that’s international in scope, but with the heart and customer service of a family-run operation. That’s Frilvam, with 70 years of experience in the coloration and additivization of thermoplastic polymers and, today, an Italian leader in the production of Masterbatches in black, white, in color or with special-effects, and biodegradables, as well as a wide range of additive Masterbatches to meet all the most specific needs.
  
Founded in the first years after World War II, Frilvam, based in northern Italy in Milan, began by marketing neutral and colored thermoplastic resins made by other manufacturers, but soon set up its own plants for the production of sample color products.

The customer service and continuous research and development that characterized its business right from the start quickly turned Frilvam into an important player in the field of technopolymers and charged and colored compounds. With the experience and know-how accumulated over the years, it eventually presented its own line of Masterbatches for thermoplastic resins.

Today, Frilvam is a leader in the Masterbatch sector;

FKuR Kunststoff GmbH
Plastics care for Future – Let`s keep it in the loop. 


FKuR is a medium-sized, privately held company focusing on the development, production and marketing of high-quality special compounds and the distribution of plastic specialties and recyclates.

We are one of the leading suppliers of bioplastics granulates for flexible packaging solutions and engineering applications.

We at FKuR are convinced that nature itself is the best recycler. That''s why we want to use targeted research and development to create
sustainable materials that on the one hand conserve fossil resources and on the other hand can be easily integrated into the reusable material cycle.

Our customers are our partners, we accompany them throughout the entire project: We recommend the most suitable plastic - be it bio-based, biodegradable or recycled - for the given application or develop an individual compound on request. As we have a broad network of reliable partners at our disposal, we can bring brand owners together with the appropriate processor. During the implementation phase, extensive technical support, including on-site customer support, is a matter of course for us. Finally, we support our customers with marketing-relevant questions within the framework of a successful market launch.

Polyethylene, biobased (Bio', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Terralene® - Tailor-made polyethylene compounds based on renewable raw materials | Eastlon - Bio-PET based on renewable raw materials | „Let’s keep it in the loop“ – sustainable plastic solutions for a circular future | „Plastics care for Future – Let`s keep it in the loop“ – Under this motto, FKuR will present its expanded portfolio of bioplastics and recyclates at K 2025 in Düsseldorf from October 8 to 15. These materials are tailored to meet the requirements of the circular economy and the European Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR).Highlights at booth E48 in Hall 6 include the soil-biodegradable Bio-Flex® N grades for agricultural and farming products, which leave no persistent microplastics behind. In addition, FKuR will showcase an expanded portfolio of high-performance post-consumer recyclates (PCR) and in-house developed recyclate compounds. A new addition is the LDPE recyclate “Paluren” from Palurec (Hürth/Germany), derived from recycled beverage cartons.Visitors will also find numerous product examples made from recyclable, bio-based Terralene® compounds based on bio-PE, as well as from the bio-based I’m green™ biobased PE and EVA grades from Braskem. Bio-based plastics are a key component in the defossilization of the plastics industry and offer sustainable solutions for applications where environmental compatibility is a top priority. Designed for Soil Biodegradability Key features of FKuR’s new Bio-Flex® N series include complete biodegradability in soil and certification according to ‘OK biodegradable SOIL’ by TÜV Austria. Depending on the grade, certification has already been granted or is currently in progress due to the lengthy testing and approval process. The portfolio includes grades for blown film, injection molding, and extrusion, all specifically developed to meet the requirements of agricultural and farming applications. All Bio-Flex® N types degrade in soil without leaving any residue and do not produce persistent microplastics. This makes them especially suitable for products that remain in nature after use or cannot be collected again—such as mulch films, binding twines, and plant clips for vegetables, growth tubes for trees, or drainage pipes in horticulture and agriculture.The already OK biodegradable SOIL-certified Bio-Flex® N 25370 is suitable for injection molding and profile extrusion products such as tree guards and growth tubes used in forestry. Despite its high density, N 25370 offers excellent flexibility.Key applications of the Bio-Flex® blown film grades N 21310 and N 31310 include mulch films as well as plant and net labels. Thanks to its well-balanced property profile, Bio-Flex® N 21310 is a suitable alternative to the industrially compostable grade Bio-Flex® F 1140 when soil biodegradability is desired. In comparison, Bio-Flex® N 31310 offers higher puncture resistance and toughness.Bio-Flex® N 45261 is suitable for injection molding and profile extrusion. Its increased stiffness and strength make it ideal for applications such as clips, plant stakes, and pots. Visually appealing LDPE recyclate from beverage cartons New to FKuR’s distribution program is the plastic recyclate Paluren. This LDPE, available in pellet form, is produced through an innovative recycling process from used beverage cartons (PolyAl) and contains around 4% aluminum flakes. This gives products made from Paluren a unique appearance.The recycling company Palurec employs a mechanical-physical process that uses no organic solvents, with water as the only separation medium. The production of Paluren LDPE meets the requirements of the German VerpackG certification as well as the RecyClass Recycling Process Certificate.Paluren can be processed similarly to conventional PE and allows the use of hot runner injection molding technology as well as common polyolefin-based color and additive masterbatches. It can also be welded and bonded. The aluminum flake content is intentionally utilized to create attractive aesthetic properties. Patrick Zimmermann, Managing Director of FKuR, states: “With the forward-looking motto of our presence at K 2025, we emphasize our ongoing commitment to circularity in the plastics industry. We demonstrate that those seeking pioneering new options for material substitution will find highly attractive solutions at FKuR that meet all regulatory requirements. This applies equally to consumer goods, packaging, and industrial applications. In this way, we help OEMs, suppliers, and processors leverage and deliver greater sustainability to their customers—with our biodegradable or bio-based plastics as well as recyclates—regardless of the industry.”', hall = '6', stand = 'E48', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Melanie Schreurs", "role": "Technical Sales Manager", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Steven Schuitema", "role": "Technical Sales Manager BeNeLux", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Carolin Theunissen", "role": "Business Development Manager", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Niklas Voß", "role": "Associate Sales Director", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Denise Martha", "role": "Head of Marketing", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Sonja Bollig", "role": "Sales Administration", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "Yvonne Fliegen", "role": "Sales Administration", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T00:55:45.126391', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

Delta Engineering bv
Delta Engineering was founded in 1992 by Danny De Bruyn and Rudy Lemeire, both engineers active in the production of plastic bottles.
Noticing the lack of efficient leak detection equipment, they started designing and producing the UDK100, a single head leak tester.
In the following months and years, they stayed very much attuned to the needs of their customers, leading quickly to the development of a whole range of solutions solving the actual problems of today companies.
This hands-on approach enabled Delta Engineering to establish a preeminent position in the industry. Today Delta Engineering counts large multinational groups, as well as smaller independently owned companies among its customers.
