Schwarz Plastic Solutions GmbH Externer Support: Duroplast + Marketing
Immediate help and external support for the plastics industry - directly from injection molding experts.

Targeted and fast help with technical problems in injection molding, component development and effective marketing for small and medium-sized companies in plastics and elastomers:

Complete DUROPLAST service
Advice, support and training in theory and practice
Design, thermal analysis
Sampling in our own technical centre, process optimization, problem solving

Plastics engineering and development partner
Material characterization in our own laboratory
Creation of extended technical data sheets and simulation maps
Simulations (mold flow, temperature control, FEA) and feasibility studies

specific marketing for technical services and products - targeted, plannable, effective
Increased findability + precise search engine optimization (SEO),
better ranking with existing websites
Improvement of company image (corporate CI, graphic styles / design)
Creation of sales material (presentations, flyers, print data)
Help with new customer acquisition (lead generation, performance marketing)
new websites / help with LinkedIn / activate sales channels
Process and product photography specifically for the plastics industry

Marketing support from A to Z, project-based and permanent support possible.


Schwarz Plastic Solutions is a team of three specialists with many years of experience, each with a different focus on specific topics that often cause difficulties in our industry.


Two of our experts are active as external technical support and problem solvers for thermosets and engineering thermoplastics. Decades of experience from injection molding production and scientific work come together here.
With our own modern injection molding technical center and laboratory, we are available to OEMs, TIERs, material manufacturers and plastics processors alike as a partner and "external team extension" with very specific knowledge.

typical topics for which we provide technical assistance:
Setting up injection molding production / transitioning prototypes to series production
Introduction of a new technology
Material development / component development
Training of specialists in production (training - coaching - education)
Problems with process or component quality in injection molding (thermoset / engineering thermoplastics)



Our third team member helps with commercial problems with a broad portfolio of technical marketing support and highly targeted actions. Marketing does not work without specialist knowledge of processes / technologies / applications and, on the other hand, knowledge of target groups and their interests or problems. This is exactly where we come in and offer the mix that makes complex technical topics appealing and addresses your target group in the right way.


typical topics that we help with in marketing:
if the external appearance or presence in the market has been neglected or is not working
if the website does not bring the desired success / visits / contacts
if there is no internal marketing and external agencies from outside the industry only cost a lot of money and bring nothing
if there are too few new customer inquiries



Despite a strong focus on reactive polymers and a specific portfolio of services, thanks to a long-standing network within the industry, we can also provide support for topics that at first glance do not fall within our core area. Talk to us and we will find a solution.

So please bring your problem to the K trade fair in Hall 7a, Stand B25-01 - we will be happy to help you.
