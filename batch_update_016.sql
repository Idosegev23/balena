Sales & Marketing Director Mikko', products_services = 'Exhibitors & Products | Bjørn Thorsen A/S is pleased to announce being appointed by Celanese as their focused distributor for elastomers in Europe. This strategic move aims to strengthen the position of Celanese''s products across the EU, contribute to the development of new applications, and customized solutions according to customer needs. | Working in the plastics industry brings more than technical expertise - it also calls for strong event management skills. At Bjørn Thorsen, organizing and participating in industry events has long been a key part of our business. Each year is typically packed, and 2025 has been no exception, especially since securing our role as a  Pan-European distributor of TPEs from Celanese .This year, however, brought a fresh perspective. It has been all about reimagining both existing and new markets with renewed focus and creativity. Months of brainstorming, designing, and refining our messaging led us to a clear and bold direction: our full commitment to Elastomers.May marked one of the busiest and most exciting periods so far, as we exhibited at both  Plassteknik in Malmö  and  Plastpol in Kielce . At these events, we unveiled a completely new stand design inspired by four iconic films. This is where creativity met strategy - using universally recognizable cinematic themes and quotes to communicate our message in an engaging and memorable way.Each movie reference was carefully selected to highlight core values of our Elastomers portfolio: performance, versatility, innovation, quality, and credibility. Just like the most enduring films, we aim for our solutions to make a lasting impact - standing the test of time in both form and function.With that, we invite you to dive into the full story behind our cinematic concept. We hope you enjoy discovering it as much as we enjoyed bringing it to life. | Exhibitors & Products | Digital Services Act (DSA)', contact_persons = '[{"name": "Mikko Långström", "role": "Bjørn Thorsen A/S", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}, {"name": "", "role": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "additional_info": ""}]'::jsonb, scraping_timestamp = '2025-09-18T00:05:23.039585', success = true, scraping_status = 'completed', data_source = 'ultimate_scraping'

ADVANCED & FUNCTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR BIOCOMPOSITES S.L.
ADBioplastics is a Spanish company specialised in the development and commercialisation of advanced additives and bioplastics.

Our PLA-Premium bioplastic improves elongation at break (mechanical properties) by up to 70%, achieving a version of PLA Premium, that is, less brittle and more elastic. We also improve processability (cycle times and density comparable to PET) and barrier properties: to water vapour and oxygen, among many other advantages.

PLA-Premium enables the development of high quality bio-based and compostable plastics, becoming the ideal substitute for conventional plastics in many sectors, such as packaging (food, cosmetics and nutrition), 3D printing, medicine, textiles, construction, agriculture and consumer goods.

Our products are bio-based and compostable, and we produce them with raw materials from renewable sources such as corn, sugar cane or beets that, under industrial conditions, disintegrate in just three months (OK Compost Industrial by TÜV Austria).

Bio-based and compostable products as a sustainable alternative to fossil plastics  Among the latest case studies to be exhibited is the joint project with Nua Cosmetics, Provei Global and ITC Packaging in the development of a bio-based and compostable bottle for baby shower gel and shampoo, a 500 ml product with a dispensing cap made of PLA-Premium bioplastic, a more sustainable option to PET bottles that not only takes care of the little ones, but also of the planet.Another of the innovative products to be shown at the ADBioplastics exhibition space is compostable cutlery for food, mainly for the ice cream industry, a project that solves one of the major problems of single-use spoons or forks that, due to their size and use, hinder the recycling system or are not recycled correctly, contaminating the environment. This single-use cutlery is suitable for food contact and allows organic recycling at the end of the product’s useful life.Finally, one of the most outstanding innovations to be presented will be the BioLoop Band, a new type of filament used as a twistband closure (a flexible wire, usually made of steel or aluminum, coated with a plastic layer, used to securely close various products). This development was first shown at the U.S. NPE show and aims to transform the use of single-use closures in sectors such as food, agriculture and consumer goods.This new filament emerges as a sustainable alternative to traditional twistband closures, either with or without metal core, made of materials such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or LDPE (low density polyethylene), commonly used to close products such as sliced bread or toy packaging, cables, extension cords and other household or electronic products. In the agricultural field, it is used for the trellising of horticultural and fruit crops, favoring the guidance of plants in systems such as Guyot pruning, widely used in viticulture for grape production. The mixed structure of conventional closures makes them difficult to recycle and generates a negative environmental impact due to their composition and small size.In contrast, BioLoop Band is made from PLA-Premium, a bioplastic that provides environmental and functional advantages. Its main benefits include: a reduction of up to 55% in the use of material compared to traditional closures with a metal core, its compostability (it can be disposed of with organic waste), respect for soil fertility, its ability to elongate with heat (which facilitates plant growth without damaging it), and its resistance to both impact and torsion, allowing its repeated use in closure processes.  Sustainable commitment and international collaboration drive  Alongside its latest innovations, ADBioplastics will showcase a wide variety of products from its portfolio, including 3D printed parts, packaging such as bottles and jars, candle holders, single-dose formats for cosmetics, flexible flowpacks, clamshells, closures, and plastic films with different characteristics and thicknesses. These developments respond to the growing demands for sustainability in industries such as food, cosmetics, agriculture, medicine, 3D printing, textiles and consumer goods.In the emerging additive manufacturing sector, PLA-Premium is setting a new stage in the development of biomaterials thanks to its excellent performance in terms of both flowability and mechanical strength. Special grades of PLA-Premium allow it to be blended with plant or mineral fibres, resulting in high-performance bio-based filaments.All products using PLA-Premium are both compostable and bio-based, and show significant improvements over pure PLA, especially in terms of physical properties and ease of processing. This material is obtained from renewable resources such as corn or sugar cane and can disintegrate in less than three months under industrial composting conditions, which is endorsed by the OK Compost Industrial certification issued by TÜV Austria.These solutions are fully in line with international sustainability policies. In Italy, one of the most advanced countries in regulating compostable materials, the government is actively promoting biotechnology and bio-manufacturing with the aim of replacing up to 90% of fossil plastics in two decades. Since 2018, it bans non-compostable lightweight plastic bags, allows single-use products if they are made from certified compostable materials, and offers tax incentives to companies that develop or use sustainable bioplastics. Italy, in fact, has already exceeded its 2030 recycling targets for compostable bioplastics. | It all started when  Provei Global  and  Nua Cosmetics  approached  ADBioplastics , a manufacturer of compostable additives and bioplastics, with the need to offer the market a bottle for shower gel and shampoo that would promote sustainability, respect for the environment and reflect the company’s values. This 500 ml bottle with a dispensing cap is a significant step forward in the mission of the companies involved to promote sustainability.Unlike conventional plastics, bio-based plastics come from renewable and non-fossil sources, which reduces the carbon footprint and, as it is also a biodegradable material, it can be converted into compost, CO2 and water as it decomposes through the biological action of certain microorganisms under industrial conditions.“At Provei Global, with Biositivo, we are committed to creating products that are fully integrated into the natural cycle, without generating waste. It is a pleasure to have partners such as Nua Cosmetics, ITC Packaging and ADBioplastics, who share our vision and have helped us develop a product that not only cares for the little ones, but also for the planet”, says Sébastien Favier, CEO of Provei Global.From a technical point of view, the  PLA-Premium  developed by ADBioplastics improves the properties of generic bioplastics, maintaining transparency and improving the barrier to both oxygen and water vapour, as well as improving toughness and impact resistance. This solution is not only environmentally friendly, but also promotes organic recycling when deposited in the brown bin, contributing to the circularity of materials and the reduction of waste in the environment.Carlos Soto, CEO of Nua Cosmetics, says: “This project has been an exciting technical challenge. Achieving the highest quality baby gel formula, which is also compatible with compostable packaging, reinforces our commitment to sustainability and the well-being of our little ones”.Xavier Serrano, PET Business Unit Manager at  ITC Packaging : “We help our customers in the process of developing their packaging to improve its sustainability and carbon footprint. With this project we have added a Bio and Compostable line to our portfolio of packaging solutions, which join the other sustainable solutions developed so far (rPET food and non-food)”.This project is in line with the objectives of ADBioplastics to contribute to the sustainability strategies of companies in order to achieve the legislative requirements set for 2030 at international level. The PLA-Premium bioplastic is suitable for food and cosmetic contact and has the OK Compost Industrial seal from TÜV Austria, certifying the transformation of the bioplastic into compost under industrial conditions, according to the EN 13432 standard, in a period of less than 6 months. *New published in  ITC Packaging ,  Alimarket ,  TecnoBebidas ,  MundoPlast ,  EnvasPrés ,  News Packaging ,  Clúster Envase ,  Yahoo! Finance ,  PackNode ,  Packaging Gateway ,  Bioplastics News  and  Packaging MEA . | ADBioplastics  and  Iraga Servicios  have developed a sustainable packaging for cutlery used in catering for air and ground passenger transport. It is a 100% compostable and bio-based flow pack packaging.This product maintains the quality characteristics and offers advantages in terms of production, such as reducing the sealing temperature by around 50%. As a consequence, CO2 emissions are reduced both in the manufacturing process of the product and in the packaging process.Furthermore, the new packaging offers a compostable solution, as the material is certified OK Compost Industrial by TÜV Austria, which verifies that the material disintegrates into its basic components (carbon dioxide and water) within a period of approximately 3 months under industrial compostability conditions. In this way, according to the current recycling circuit, the material can be deposited in the brown (organic) container and then transferred to a composting plant.  A long-term project  The main objective of this agreement has been to offer a more sustainable alternative for shrink-wrapping processes by means of a film supplied by ADBioplastics in the catering of Iraga Servicios’ main passenger transport customers, thus promoting compliance with legislative requirements, innovation and the circular economy.This film has been obtained from TecnoBi grades of  PLA-Premium  compostable bioplastic, developed by ADBioplastics. The technology used to manufacture the film is film cast extrusion, resulting in a product with characteristics similar to those of a film made from conventional plastic. PLA-Premium can also be processed on conventional equipment, so it does not require any additional investment in equipment or infrastructure. Sustainability is a fundamental pillar for  ADBioplastics  and  Iraga Servicios , which through this cooperation agreement will be able to offer products and materials for compostable and bio-based packaging, in line with their long-term management and innovation strategies.This project demonstrates that it is possible to combine respect for the environment and social welfare with business profit, contributing to compliance with the sustainability objectives set out in the Law on Waste and Contaminated Soil for a Circular Economy and the Royal Decree on Packaging and Packaging Waste. ADBioplastics is a startup dedicated to the manufacture of tailor-made bioplastics that improve the mechanical properties of virgin PLA for food, beverage and cosmetic packaging  applications , as well as other plastic products for 3D printing, textiles, medicine, agriculture and construction.Iraga Servicios is a company specialised, among others, in shrink wrapping and manual handling, with extensive experience in the airline catering and ground passenger transport sector.
